ix</span>PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.</h2>
<p>This little volume has been twice published, and this issue of
it is in ready response to the &ldquo;third time of asking&rdquo;
by an appreciating public, largely, as we imagine, made up of
families associated in some way or other with &ldquo;Old
Liverpool&rdquo; as it appeared in the earlier part of the
present century.</p>
<p>The traditions of the &ldquo;Good Old Town&rdquo; naturally
have an interest to many of us who are also quite able and
equally willing to estimate at their full value the modern
development and rapid progress of the &ldquo;New City.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The inaudible and noiseless foot of
time&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>passes rapidly on, but even the days that are spent may</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As withered roses yield a late
perfume,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so give us often very bright and happy retrospects.</p>
<p>Perhaps it may soon be a self-inspired and pleasurable task
for someone to take up the thread of the &ldquo;Old
Stager&rsquo;s&rdquo; story, and bring it down to the present <a
name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p. x</span>time.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, let us hope that the kindly enterprise of the
publisher may be rewarded by a rapid demand for this little book,
at once of real interest to old Liverpool families and at the
same time so simple and sketchy in its style as to give it no
place whatever in the &ldquo;records&rdquo; of the community.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">CLARKE ASPINALL.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liverpool</span>, 1885.</p>
<h2><a name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xi</span>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
<p>In the year 1852, <i>Liverpool a Few Years Since</i>, by
&ldquo;An Old Stager,&rdquo; was republished in &ldquo;a more
abiding form&rdquo; than it had previously assumed in the columns
of the <i>Liverpool Albion</i>.&nbsp; The little book sold off
rapidly, notwithstanding its being somewhat expensive, as
compared with the wonderfully cheap publications of the day, and
it is now out of print.&nbsp; It has many a time and oft been
suggested that a further and cheaper issue would be acceptable to
the Liverpool public, The publisher has, therefore, assumed the
responsibility of the present issue; and, learning that such was
his intention, I have ventured to &ldquo;preface&rdquo; the
original preface by a word or two in explanation of the
circumstances and surroundings under which the Author penned
these sketches.</p>
<p>It is scarcely imparting information, to make known the simple
truth that the &ldquo;Old Stager&rdquo; in question was none
other than the late Rev. James Aspinall, M.A. Oxon, at one time
Incumbent of St. Michael&rsquo;s Church, and more recently
officiating at St. Luke&rsquo;s, <a name="pagexii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xii</span>and afterwards transferred to the
Crown Rectory of Althorpe in Lincolnshire, where he continued to
reside until his death in 1861.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Old
Stager&rdquo; was always a man of great activity of mind and
body, and could never be idle.&nbsp; Every moment of his time was
turned to some account; and thus the very remote sphere of his
parochial and magisterial duties in Lincolnshire never induced
the slightest dulness or discontent.&nbsp; With a Church, and a
Chapel of Ease three or four miles off, to serve, and with a
tolerably large parish to care for, the &ldquo;Old Stager&rdquo;
was not without considerable clerical duty; and, added to this,
he most unwillingly undertook the responsibilities of the
magisterial office.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the avocations thus
indicated, time was always found for literary pursuits, for
receiving and imparting knowledge, for refreshing and renewing
his powers of mind, in order to the successful communication,
either by voice or pen, of his thoughts and ideas to his
neighbours and to the general public.&nbsp; Amid the many written
utterances of the &ldquo;Old Stager&rsquo;s&rdquo; ready and
comprehensive mind, we must enumerate these notes upon men and
things in our good old town, penned with very considerable
pleasure to their writer, as being the jottings down of his own
personal experiences and recollections of a place and of a people
very deeply rooted in the affections of this true son of
Liverpool.</p>
<p>We well remember the bright and genial countenance of the
&ldquo;Old Stager,&rdquo; as he thought aloud upon his old and
early associations.&nbsp; Liverpool was his home, as against all
other homes.&nbsp; His father had <a name="pagexiii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xiii</span>been its chief magistrate so long
ago as 1803.&nbsp; His sons, or some of them, had adopted it as
their abiding place; and thus, for several generations, this
thriving community seemed to the &ldquo;Old Stager&rdquo; to
smile upon him and upon his belongings, and as a consequence, not
at all unnatural, the &ldquo;Old Stager&rdquo; felt a devotion to
the town, and towards its inhabitants, which kept it and them
ever in his grateful remembrance.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">C. A.</p>

<h2><a name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xiv</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The original intention of the Author was to amuse the younger
readers of the <i>Albion</i>, by dashing off a few sketches of
&ldquo;men and things,&rdquo; as he recollects them in Liverpool
a few years since.&nbsp; For this purpose all that was worth
telling, he thought, might be comprised in about two papers, or
chapters.&nbsp; The public, however, like hungry Oliver Twist,
revelling on the thin workhouse gruel, flatteringly asked for
&ldquo;more&rdquo;; and with this request he, not being of a
nature akin to that of Mr. Bumble, has willingly complied to the
extent of his ability.&nbsp; Nor is this all for which the
naughty public is to be held responsible.&nbsp; The chapters
having been spun out to the length which they now occupy, greedy
Oliver again cries out for &ldquo;more,&rdquo; and demands that,
instead of being left to die out, and be forgotten, as the
ephemeral occupants of the columns of a newspaper, they shall be
collected, and re-published in a more abiding form; and once more
our good nature triumphs over our prudence, and we comply.&nbsp;
Under such circumstances, the writer of these sketches and
reminiscences <a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>neither courts nor deprecates criticism; his only object
in perpetrating these &ldquo;trifles light as air&rdquo; was, he
repeats, to set before the rising generation a picture of the
&ldquo;good&rdquo; old town, at the commencement of the present
century, and to show them how &ldquo;men and manners,&rdquo; and
customs and fashions, have changed since the times in which their
grandfathers &ldquo;ruled the roast,&rdquo; and were the heroes
of the day.&nbsp; In working out this design, the Author has had
neither dates nor memoranda to refer to, but has trusted entirely
to his own powers of recollection, even as far back as the period
when he reached the mature age of six years!&nbsp; It is
satisfactory, however, to add that, although he has painted
wholly from memory, no one has yet disputed the accuracy of any
of the characters which he has drawn, the events which he has
related, or the anecdotes which he has revived.&nbsp; This may be
fairly assumed as a testimony in favour of their
correctness.&nbsp; For the rest, he has only once more to say,
with Horace, &ldquo;<i>Non meus hic sermo</i>,&rdquo; etc.; that
is, our re-appearance is no fault of our own.&nbsp; Oliver Twist
&ldquo;has done it all,&rdquo; and must bear the blame.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='W' title='W' src='images/dc1.jpg' />e are
not great at statistics.&nbsp; We do not pretend to be accurate
to an hour in dates, chronology, and so forth.&nbsp; We write,
indeed, entirely from memory, and therefore may perhaps
occasionally go wrong in fixing &ldquo;the hour for the man, and
the man for the hour,&rdquo; as we dot down a few of our
recollections of the &ldquo;good old town of Liverpool,&rdquo;
from the time when we cast off our swaddling clothes, crept out
of our cradle, opened our eyes, and began to exercise our
reasoning powers on men and things as in those days they
presented themselves to our view.&nbsp; We think that our memory
has a faint glimmering of the illuminations which took place when
peace was made with Napoleon, in 1801.&nbsp; We also remember
being called out of our bed to gaze at the terrible flames when
the Goree warehouses were burnt down, and how we crept out of the
house at day dawn, and rushed to see the blazing mass and all its
tottering ruins in dangerous proximity.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>It might
only have happened yesterday, so vividly is the scene impressed
upon our mind.&nbsp; But what was Liverpool in those days of
early hours, pigtails, routs and hair-powder?</p>
<p>The docks ended with George&rsquo;s at one extremity and the
Queen&rsquo;s at the other.&nbsp; There was a battery near the
latter and another near the former.&nbsp; Farther north was a
large fort of some thirty guns, and halfway towards Bootle, a
smaller one with nine.&nbsp; The town hardly on one side extended
beyond Colquitt-street.&nbsp; The greater part of Upper
Duke-street was unbuilt.&nbsp; Cornwallis-street, the large house
which Mr. Morrall erected, the ground on which St.
Michael&rsquo;s Church stands, all were fields at the time of
which we speak.&nbsp; There was a picturesque-looking mill at the
top of Duke-street, and behind Rodney-street we had a narrow
lane, with a high bank overgrown with roses.&nbsp;
Russell-street, Seymour-street, and all beyond were still free
from bricks.&nbsp; Lime-street was bounded by a field, in which
many a time we watched rough lads chasing cocks on Shrove Tuesday
for a prize, the competitors having their hands tied behind them,
and catching at the victims with their mouths.&nbsp; Edge-hill,
Everton, and Kirkdale were villages, as yet untouched by the huge
Colossus which has since absorbed them and transmuted them into
suburbs.&nbsp; What pilgrimages we children used to achieve to
the second of these places, the very Mecca of our affections,
that we might expend our small cash upon genuine Molly
Bushell&rsquo;s toffee.&nbsp; And what wonderful tales we heard
from our nurses and companions about Prince Rupert&rsquo;s <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>Cottage,&mdash;only lately demolished by some modern
Goth, under the plea of improvement!&nbsp; And then we crept on
to peep at the old beacon at San Domingo, thinking what a clever
device it was to rouse and alarm the country, never dreaming in
our young heads of telegraphs, and electric telegraphs, and other
inventions, which have now superseded the rude makeshifts of our
forefathers.&nbsp; And what a grand house we thought Mr.
Harper&rsquo;s, at Everton, now turned into barracks.&nbsp; And
Hope-street, now so central, then gave no hopes of
existence.&nbsp; It was country altogether.&nbsp; At one end of
it were two gentlemen&rsquo;s seats, inhabited by the families of
Corrie and Thomas, and far removed from the smoke and bustle of
the town.</p>
<p>But go we back to the docks.&nbsp; There were no steamers in
those days to tow out our vessels.&nbsp; The wind ruled supreme,
without a rival.&nbsp; The consequence was, that when, after a
long stretch of contrary winds, a change took place, and a
favourable breeze set in, a whole fleet of ships would at once be
hauled out of dock, and start upon their several voyages.&nbsp;
It was a glorious spectacle.&nbsp; It was the delight of our
younger days to be present on all such occasions.&nbsp; How we
used to fly about, sometimes watching the dashing American ships
as they left the King&rsquo;s and Queen&rsquo;s Docks, and
sometimes taking a peep at the coasters in the Salthouse Dock, or
at the African traders in the Old Dock, since filled up, at the
instigation of some goose anxious to emulate the fame of the man
who set fire to the Temple at Ephesus.&nbsp; This fatal blunder
it was which first gave a wrong direction to our docks, <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>stretching them
out northwards and southwards <i>in extenso</i>, instead of
centralising and keeping them together.&nbsp; But we must not
moralise.&nbsp; We are at the dock side, or on the
pierhead.&nbsp; The tide is rising, the wind is favourable,
&ldquo;The sea, the sea, the open sea,&rdquo; is the word with
all.&nbsp; What bustle and confusion!&nbsp; What making fast and
casting off of ropes!&nbsp; How the captains shout!&nbsp; How the
men swear!&nbsp; How the dock-masters rush about!&nbsp; What
horrible &ldquo;confusion worse confounded&rdquo; seems to
prevail!&nbsp; And yet there is method in all this seeming
madness.&nbsp; Order will presently come out of all this apparent
chaos.&nbsp; The vessels pass through the dockgates.&nbsp; Meat
and bread are tossed on board of them at the last moment.&nbsp;
Friends are bidding farewell!&nbsp; Wives tremble and look
pale.&nbsp; There is a tear in the stout-hearted sailor&rsquo;s
eye as he waves his adieu.&nbsp; But, &ldquo;Give way, give way
there, my lads; heave away my hearties!&rdquo;&nbsp; The vessel
clears the dock, passes through the gut, and then pauses for a
brief space at the pier, while the sails are set and
trimmed.&nbsp; Then comes the final word, &ldquo;Cast off that
rope!&rdquo; and many a time have we, at hearing it, tugged with
our tiny hands until we have succeeded in effecting it, and then
strutted away as proudly as if we had just won Waterloo or
Trafalgar.&nbsp; And now the sails fill; she moves, she starts,
there is a cheer, &ldquo;Off she goes!&rdquo; dashing the spray
on either side of her as soon as ever she feels the breeze.&nbsp;
And now all the river is alive.&nbsp; The heavy Baltic vessels
are creeping away.&nbsp; The Americans, always the same, are
cracking along with every stitch of canvas they can <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>carry.&nbsp;
The West Indiamen sail nobly along, like the very rulers of the
ocean.&nbsp; There are the coasters, and the Irish traders, and
packets, while the smart pilot-boat dashes along under easy sail,
here, there, and everywhere almost at the same time.&nbsp; And so
they go on, until, like a dissolving view, they are lost behind
the Rock, and we retire from our post, with the determination to
be there again when the same scene is repeated.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>CHAPTER
II.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='B' title='B' src='images/dc2.jpg' />ut the
peace of which we spoke in our last chapter was nothing but a
hollow and armed truce, which gave both parties time to breathe
for a few months.&nbsp; England was suspicious.&nbsp; Napoleon
was ambitious.&nbsp; The press galled him to the quick.&nbsp; At
all events, &ldquo;the dogs of war&rdquo; were hardly tied up
before they were again &ldquo;let slip&rdquo;; and then into what
a bustle, and what a fever of excitement, do we remember old
Liverpool to have been plunged.&nbsp; What cautions and
precautions we used to take, both by land and water.&nbsp; We had
a venerable guard ship in the river, the &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo;
which we believe had originally been a Dutch man-of-war, and, if
built to swim, was certainly never intended to sail.&nbsp; There
she used to lie at her moorings, opposite the old George&rsquo;s
Dock pier, lazily swinging backwards and forwards, with the
ebbing and flowing of the tide, and looking as if she had been
built expressly for that very purpose and no other. Her very
shadow seemed to grow into that part of the river on which she
lay.&nbsp; But, besides her, we had generally some old-fashioned
vessel of war, which had come round from Portsmouth or Plymouth
to receive <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>volunteers, or impressed men.&nbsp; A word about these
last.&nbsp; Those who live in these &ldquo;piping times of
peace&rdquo; have no idea of the means which were employed in the
days of which we are speaking, to man our vessels of war.&nbsp;
The sailors in our merchant service had to run the gauntlet, as
it were, for their liberty, from one end of the world to the
other.&nbsp; A ship of war, falling in with a merchant vessel in
any part of the globe, would unceremoniously take from her the
best seamen, leaving her just hands enough to bring her
home.&nbsp; As they approached the English shore, our cruisers,
hovering in all directions, would take their pick of the
remainder.&nbsp; But the great terror of the sailor was the press
gang.&nbsp; Such was the dread in which this force was held by
the blue-jackets, that they would often take to their boats on
the other side of the Black Rock, that they might conceal
themselves in Cheshire; and many a vessel had to be brought into
port by a lot of riggers and carpenters, sent round by the owner
for that purpose.&nbsp; And, truly, according to our
reminiscences, the press-gang was, even to look at, something
calculated to strike fear into a stout man&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp;
They had what they called a &ldquo;Rendezvous,&rdquo; in
different parts of the town.&nbsp; There was one we recollect, in
Old Strand-street.&nbsp; From the upper window there was always a
flag flying, to notify to volunteers what sort of business was
transacted there.&nbsp; But look at the door, and at the people
who are issuing from it.&nbsp; They are the Press-gang.&nbsp; At
their head there was generally a rakish, dissipated, but
determined looking officer, in a very seedy uniform and shabby
hat.&nbsp; And <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>what followers!&nbsp; Fierce, savage, stern,
villainous-looking fellows were they, as ready to cut a throat as
eat their breakfast.&nbsp; What an uproar their appearance always
made in the streets!&nbsp; The men scowled at them as they
passed; the women openly scoffed at them; the children screamed,
and hid themselves behind doors or fled round the corners.&nbsp;
And how rapidly the word was passed from mouth to mouth, that
there were &ldquo;hawks abroad,&rdquo; so as to give time to any
poor sailor who had incautiously ventured from his place of
concealment to return to it.&nbsp; But woe unto him if there were
no warning voice to tell him of the coming danger; he was seized
upon as if he were a common felon, deprived of his liberty, torn
from his home, his friends, his parents, wife or children,
hurried to the rendezvous-house, examined, passed, and sent on
board the tender, like a negro to a slave-ship.&nbsp; And so it
went on, until the floating prison was filled with captives, when
the living cargo was sent round to one of the outports, and the
prisoners were divided among the vessels of war which were in
want of men.&nbsp; Persons of the present generation have
certainly heard of the press-gang, but they never attempt to
realise the horrors by which it was accompanied.&nbsp; Nay, the
generality seem to us to hardly believe in its existence, but
rather to classify it with <i>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</i>,
<i>Don Quixote</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, or the <i>Heathen
Mythology</i>.&nbsp; But we can recollect its working.&nbsp; We
have seen the strong man bent to tears, and reduced to
woman&rsquo;s weakness by it.&nbsp; We have seen parents made, as
it were, childless, through its operation; the wife <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>widowed, with a
husband yet alive; children orphaned by the forcible abduction of
their fathers.&nbsp; And yet, there were many in those days, not
only naval men, but statesmen and legislators, who venerated the
press-gang as one of the pillars and institutions of the
country.&nbsp; In those days, indeed!&nbsp; We much fear that, if
even now we could look into the heart of hearts of many a veteran
admiral and captain, we should find that they have, in the event
of a war, no other plan in their heads for manning the navy but a
return to this dreadful and oppressive system.&nbsp; We would,
however, recommend those in whose department it lies to be
devising some other scheme, as we are strongly impressed with the
conviction that public opinion will not in these days tolerate,
under any plea or excuse of necessity, such an infringement upon
the liberty of the subject.&nbsp; But we are not writing a
political article, but only describing our old-world
fashions.&nbsp; Pretty rows and riots, you may suppose, now and
then occurred between the press-gang and the fighting part of the
public; and not a few do we remember to have witnessed in our
younger days.&nbsp; On more than one occasion we have seen a
rendezvous-house gutted and levelled to the ground.</p>
<p>Sometimes the sailors and their friends would show fight, and,
as the mob always joined them, the press-gang invariably got the
worst of it in such battles.&nbsp; Sometimes, too, the
press-gangers would &ldquo;get into the wrong box,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;take the wrong sow by the ear,&rdquo; by seizing an
American sailor or a carpenter, and then there was sure to be a
squall.&nbsp; The bells from the <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>shipbuilding yards would boom out
their warning call in the latter case, and thousands would muster
to set their companion at liberty.&nbsp; A press-gangman was
occasionally tarred and feathered in those days, when caught
alone.&nbsp; We remember, as if it were only yesterday, walking
down South Castle Street (it was Pool Lane then), with the Old
Dock, where the Custom-house now stands, before us.&nbsp; It was,
for some reason or other, tolerably clear of ships at the
time.&nbsp; We well remember, however, that there was one large
vessel, or hulk, somewhere about the middle.&nbsp; Before we tell
what happened, we must observe that, attached to the Strand
Street press-gang, there was one most extra piratical-looking
scoundrel, named Jack Something-or-other.&nbsp; Perhaps, as is
often the case, &ldquo;they gave the devil more than his
due;&rdquo; but, if one half of the things said against this Jack
were true, he deserved to be far and away prince and potentate
and prime minister in Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s Chamber of
Horrors.&nbsp; Well, as aforesaid, the Old Dock was in front of
us, when all at once we heard a noise behind us, which told us
that the game was up, and the hounds well laid on and in full
cry.</p>
<p>At the same moment, Jack shot past us, like an arrow from a
bow, while hundreds of men, women, and children, were howling,
shouting, screaming, yelling, threatening close behind him.&nbsp;
Every street sent forth its crowd to intercept him.&nbsp; There
was no turning until he reached the dock-quay, but there the
carters and porters rushed forward to stop him.&nbsp; What was to
be done?&nbsp; How was he to escape?&nbsp; <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>The dock, as
we said before, was in front, and there was the vessel in the
middle.&nbsp; Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, the terrified
wretch took the water, dived, like Rob Roy, to baffle his
pursuers, and soon gained the deck of the hulk.&nbsp; Some talked
of boarding her, and dragging him from his concealment; but the
majority of the mob decided that justice was better than
vengeance, and, satisfied with Jack&rsquo;s fright and ducking,
concluded that although he was a bad one, he was game, and would
make them more sport another time, and so dispersed.</p>

12</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='W' title='W' src='images/dc3.jpg' />e spoke
of the old guardship, the &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; in our last
chapter.&nbsp; Many and many a time have we walked on her deck,
until we thought that we ourselves might grow into a Nelson, a
St. Vincent, or a Collingwood.&nbsp; Her captain, who used to
take us on board with him, in the days of which we speak, was
Colquitt&mdash;Captain Colquitt, of course, when afloat, but, on
shore, among his friends, and he had many, Sam Colquitt, glorious
Sam, pleasant Sam, clever Sam, up to anything, equal to anything,
with a never-failing amount of fun and frolic, and an untiring
fund of conversation, generally instructive, always agreeable, a
giver and taker of a joke, full of anecdote, and the best teller
of a good story we ever met with.&nbsp; We like to dwell upon his
name.&nbsp; Much of the happiness of our boyhood sprung from our
acquaintance with him.&nbsp; Beyond him, we recollect but the
name of one of the crowd of faces which we used to see in the
&ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; the purser&rsquo;s clerk, named Vardy, a
tall, fine looking fellow, some six feet two in height.&nbsp; And
where are all the rest of them?&nbsp; How many survive?&nbsp; And
where, and how, are those who do, supported?</p>
<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Besides
the &ldquo;Princess,&rdquo; and the tubs of tenders which came
round for the impressed men, we had occasionally a livelier and
more interesting kind of craft in the Mersey.&nbsp; A dashing
sloop of war would now and then look in, after a cruise in the
Channel, and occasionally would act as convoy to any fleet of
vessels bent upon a long voyage.&nbsp; It was interesting to see
the start of one of these accumulations of ships, under the care
of their watchful guardian.&nbsp; There they lay in the river,
all prepared to make sail whenever she made the signal, with all
sorts of noises and confusion going on among their crews.&nbsp;
In the midst of them she was at anchor, with everything made snug
on board, lying like a duck on the water, with silence and order
prevailing from one end of her to the other.&nbsp; Spying glasses
are turned towards her, but there is no appearance of hurry or
anxiety.&nbsp; The wind chops round, and is favourable for
outward-bound vessels.&nbsp; Still all is quiet and motionless in
the man-of-war.&nbsp; We are not nautical, recollect, and only
speak in landsman&rsquo;s phraseology.&nbsp; What we cannot
accomplish we will not attempt.&nbsp; All eyes are now anxiously
bent towards her, and the skippers of the merchantmen begin
inwardly, and perhaps outwardly, some of them, to curse the
caprice, or ignorance, or indolence of her captain; but, all in
good time, gentlemen.&nbsp; Let him alone, if you please.&nbsp;
He knows what he is about.&nbsp; He is only doubting whether the
change of wind will hold.&nbsp; At last he is satisfied, and
look!&mdash;a flash&mdash;a smoke&mdash;bang!&nbsp; It is the
signal gun to make ready; another to weigh anchor&mdash;another
to set sail&mdash;and <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>away she goes, gracefully, like a hen
followed by her chickens; or, to speak more appropriately, like a
sheep-dog marshalling the flock.&nbsp; Sailing in convoy was
certainly all equality and fraternity, but there was no
liberty.&nbsp; The fast-sailing vessels were compelled to hoist
no more canvass than would enable their slow companions to keep
up with them.&nbsp; It was like the bed of Procrustes applied to
sea affairs.&nbsp; And what fun it was to watch the crowd of
vessels as they rounded the narrow channel by the Rock; such
bumping and thumping, such fidgeting and signal-firing on the
part of the guardian angel to check the fast ones, and stimulate
the slow ones, and keep them all well together.</p>
<p>Nor must we forget here to mention another class of vessels,
which made a very remarkable and prominent feature of the days
which we are describing.&nbsp; We speak of the privateer.&nbsp;
Liverpool was famous for this kind of craft.&nbsp; The fastest
sailing vessels were, of course, selected for this service; and,
as the men shipped on board of them were safe, in virtue of the
letter of marque, from impressment, the most dashing and daring
of the sailors came out of their hiding-holes to take service in
them.&nbsp; On the day when such a vessel left the dock, the
captain, or owner, generally gave a grand dinner to his friends,
and it was a great treat to be of the party.&nbsp; While the good
things were being discussed in the cabin, toasts given, speeches
made, and all the rest of it, she continued to cruise in the
river, with music playing, colours flying, the centre of
attraction and admiration, &ldquo;the observed of all <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>observers,&rdquo; as she dashed like a flying-fish
through the water.&nbsp; And then the crew?&nbsp; The captain was
always some brave, daring man, who had fought his way to his
position.&nbsp; The officers were selected for the same
qualities; and the men&mdash;what a reckless, dreadnaught,
dare-devil collection of human beings, half-disciplined, but yet
ready to obey every order, the more desperate the better.&nbsp;
Your true privateer&rsquo;s-man was a sort of &ldquo;half-horse,
half-alligator, with a streak of lightning&rdquo; in his
composition&mdash;something like a man-of-war&rsquo;s man, but
much more like a pirate&mdash;generally with a superabundance of
whisker, as if he held, with Samson, that his strength was in the
quantity of his hair.&nbsp; And how they would cheer, and be
cheered, as we passed any other vessel in the river; and when the
eating and drinking and speaking and toasting were over, and the
boat was lowered, and the guests were in it, how they would cheer
again, more lustily than ever, as the rope was cast off, and, as
the landsmen were got rid of, put about their own vessel, with
fortune and the world before them, and French West Indiamen and
Spanish galleons in hope and prospect.&nbsp; Those were jolly
days to some people, but we trust we may never see the like of
them again.&nbsp; The dashing man-of-war, and the daring
privateer, dazzled the eyes of the understanding, and kindled
wild and fierce enthusiasm on all sides.&nbsp; The Park and Tower
guns and the <i>Extraordinary Gazette</i> confirmed the madness,
and kept up a constant fever of excitement.&nbsp; But count the
cost.&nbsp; Lift up the veil, and peep at the hideous features of
the demon of war.&nbsp; Look at the <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>mouldering corruption beneath the
whited sepulchre of glory!&nbsp; But no sermons, if you
please.</p>
<p>And there were the old Dublin packets in those days, before
steam had turned sailor.&nbsp; If you took a passage in one of
them, and had a fair wind, and were lucky, you might hope to
arrive in Dublin some time, but if the wind were against you,
then, as the old coachman said of the railway smash, &ldquo;Where
were you?&rdquo;&nbsp; You would be heard of eventually, when
worn to a skeleton, and in a fit of indigestion from eating your
shoe soles in the agony of starvation.&nbsp; And some of us used
to get an annual voyage to Hilbre Island, an exploit which set us
up as sailors for life.&nbsp; Occasionally visitors penetrated
about as often to the one good house which was near the
magazines.&nbsp; The Old Priory at Birkenhead was then
&ldquo;alone in its glory.&rdquo;&nbsp; All Cheshire, indeed, was
in those days a kind of Africa, inviting and daring the young
Bruces and Mungo Parks of Liverpool to explore it.&nbsp; We
considered it to abound in deserts and Great Saharas.&nbsp; To
penetrate to Wallasey, or to Upton, was to reach Timbuctoo.&nbsp;
Bidston and the Lighthouse were our Cairo and the Pyramids; and
as to Leasowe Castle, we cared not to approach it, under especial
guardianship of so many fairies, ghosts, and hobgoblins was it
supposed to be.&nbsp; These things sound like so many fables at
the present day, when our steamboats, bridging the river, carry
us across by thousands every hour.&nbsp; But in those times, an
occasional ferry-boat was the only communication between the
Lancashire and Cheshire shores of the Mersey.&nbsp; Few loved to
<a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>cross from
the one to the other, except under the pressure of business or
necessity.&nbsp; Many persons, indeed, going from Liverpool to
Chester, would travel round by Warrington, rather than chance a
rough passage across the river in a small dangerous-looking
boat.&nbsp; But <i>nous avons chang&eacute; tout cela</i>.&nbsp;
The things which we have been telling only live in the memory of
a very few old fellows like ourselves.</p>
<h2><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='B' title='B' src='images/dc4.jpg' />ut when
the war, at the beginning of the century, was renewed with
Napoleon, the preparations against him were not confined to the
water.&nbsp; We had not only our guardship in the river, but the
town itself was stoutly garrisoned against any enemy.&nbsp; We
had always several regiments of regular soldiers or militia
quartered here.&nbsp; But, besides these, O! what drumming and
fifing and bugling and trumpeting there used to be among the
regiments of our own raising; for old Liverpool did her duty well
and nobly in those days of threatened invasion.&nbsp; Young and
old, gentle and simple, high and lowly were all alike seized with
a military fever and a patriotic glow, and hastened to don red
coats and cocked hats, carry muskets, or wear swords by their
sides.&nbsp; And some famous soldiers we had amongst us, and
plenty of them.&nbsp; Let us see.&nbsp; There was Colonel
Bolton&rsquo;s regiment, consisting of as fine and
well-disciplined a body of men as ever mounted guard in St.
James&rsquo;s or Buckingham Palace. In what awe we used to stand
of the tall, upright, somewhat prim, and starched old colonel,
as, mounted on his favourite white charger, he marched, band <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>playing,
colours flying, at the head of his men, round and round Mosslake
fields, looking, both he and they, defiance at all the world in
general, and Napoleon, and Ney, and Soult, and Lannes, and
Davoust, and Murat, and all the rest of the frog-eaters in
particular.&nbsp; And then there was the fine old major, called
Joe Greaves among his familiars, who lived at the top of Mount
Pleasant, and kept a glorious house, and welcomed everybody, and
was welcome everywhere.&nbsp; A fine fellow was the major as ever
we set eyes upon, and he was the father of as fine a family as
ever sprung up, like olive branches, round any man&rsquo;s
table.&nbsp; He was always kind, affable, and good-natured,
whenever we met him.&nbsp; Peace to his memory!&nbsp; And Sir
Thomas Brancker, quiet citizen as he now looks, used to wear, to
us, a most formidable aspect, when an officer in Bolton&rsquo;s
Invincibles.&nbsp; Occasionally he would act as adjutant to the
regiment, and, if our memory does not fail us at this distance of
time, we once saw him&mdash;we certainly saw some one achieve the
feat&mdash;ride at a troublesome boy, who would intrude within
the line of sentinels, and leap his horse clear over the head of
the terrified urchin.&nbsp; We also recollect a Hurry and an
Aspinall, officers in this regiment.&nbsp; There was also Colonel
Williams&rsquo;s regiment of volunteers, a fine body of men, and
well ordered and officered.&nbsp; The colonel had seen some hard
service, and heard real hostile bullets whistling abroad.&nbsp;
He was a strict disciplinarian, and a good soldier.&nbsp; We need
not attempt to describe him.&nbsp; He lived to so ripe an old
age, and to the last took such an active part in <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>our public
affairs, that most of our readers must have his picture, in his
white Russian ducks, fully impressed upon their memory.&nbsp; He
was an ardent lover of his race and of his country, spared no
labour in the cause of improvement and reform, and in
earnestness, and sincerity, and integrity of purpose never was
surpassed.&nbsp; Moreover, we had Colonel Earle&rsquo;s regiment
of Fusiliers; a company of Artillery, commanded by Major
Brancker, the father of Sir Thomas; a Custom-house Corps; a Rifle
Corps, second to none in the country; and Major Faulkner&rsquo;s
Light Horse, better mounted than any cavalry in the
service.&nbsp; And the military infection spread so far that the
very boys at the schools used to form themselves into regiments,
and drum about the streets, with their little colours streaming
in their front.&nbsp; And what reviews there were on the North
Shore, and sham fights!&nbsp; And the waterside carts were all
numbered, so as to be easily brought into use in case of an enemy
appearing.&nbsp; Occasionally the soldiers were practised in
them.&nbsp; Benches for seats were placed in them, and they would
drive off as if for some distant place, to which a railway would
now carry them like a flash of lightning.&nbsp; Once or twice
there were sham alarms, raised in the night to try the activity
and spirit of our volunteers; and O! what rattling of artillery,
galloping of horsemen, beating of drums, and blowing of trumpets
aroused the affrighted women and children from their beds, to
look at the crowds of soldiers rushing through the streets to the
several places of mustering for which they were bound.&nbsp; One
of the <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>most distinguished officers quartered amongst us in
those bustling old times was Colonel Stuart, now the Marquis of
Londonderry.&nbsp; A strange man is this said old marquis
reported to be, and funny stories are told of him as ambassador
at Vienna, and in various matters, political and
diplomatic.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, a daring and gallant soldier
was he in his youth; and, as a cavalry officer, in dash and
skill, was reckoned, not only second, but almost equal, to Murat,
the Marquis of Anglesea, and perhaps Jerome Buonaparte, whose
desperate charges at Waterloo drew from his brother the
exclamation, that if all had fought like him the day would have
had a different issue.&nbsp; Well do we recollect Colonel Stuart,
on his prancing Arabian horse, which he had brought with him from
the Egyptian campaign; and a noble pair they looked as they
dashed along.&nbsp; There was a rumour at the time, let us hope
an idle one, that this steed of Araby was begged from him by a
royal duke, and subsequently passed into a hackney coach.&nbsp;
And how well do we recollect the encampment which was formed one
summer, somewhere towards Litherland, and how the proud soldiers,
living under tents, fancied that they were undergoing all the
horrors and hardships of war in behalf of their beloved
country.&nbsp; And what heroes we had in command of this military
district.&nbsp; There was old General Benson, whose quarters were
in Islington, a little of a martinet, and more of a prig, with a
large slice of the pedant in things warlike&mdash;a regular old
pig-tail, but reputed to be a good soldier.&nbsp; After him, we
had a hero of <a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>another cut, figure, and appearance, General Fisher,
whom it was glorious to behold.&nbsp; We will attempt to describe
him.&nbsp; It was his custom to creep up Duke Street, where he
was quartered, every morning before breakfast.&nbsp; He used to
have on a pair of long, light blue pantaloons; slippers, down at
the heels; a seedy coat, dear at three-halfpence for a
scare-crow; a cocked hat to match, with much more grease than nap
on it&mdash;we all hated Nap in those days&mdash;and a little
feather, about two inches high, just peeping above it.&nbsp; And
then the figure of fun arrayed in these habiliments.&nbsp; The
general was a stout man, with rather a protuberant
corporation.&nbsp; His cheeks bore the marks, it may be of many
campaigns, but certainly of many vintages.&nbsp; He blushed port
wine unceasingly.&nbsp; His nose, no small one, grew into
something like a large bulbous root towards the extremity; and he
wore a pig-tail, huge in its dimensions, both as to length,
breadth, and thickness, even in those days of pig-tails.&nbsp;
Such was the one-time champion of this district, as he might be
seen creeping every morning through the streets, with his hands
in his pantaloon pockets, not unlike an old pantaloon himself,
and with a crowd of little boys admiring the war-like apparition,
but strongly doubting whether it was St. George or the Dragon
that stood before them.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='W' title='W' src='images/dc5.jpg' />e spoke,
in our last chapter, of the false alarms by which the soldiers
forming our garrison were once or twice called together in the
night, to try their zeal and alacrity; and we said how terribly
alarmed were the women and children on such occasions.&nbsp; But
we can, as truly as proudly, add that their fears did not extend
to our brave and gallant volunteers.&nbsp; They rushed to their
gathering spots, wild and eager for the coming danger, and, we
verily believe, were sorely disappointed when they found that the
actual opportunity had not arrived for teaching the enemy how
Englishmen could fight for their country, their king, their
altars, hearths, and homes.&nbsp; Let us, however, be thankful
that we were never subjected to the horrors of invasion, but that
the bold front of our champions kept it and them at a
distance.&nbsp; The worst of our military fever was, that, in
imitation of the bad practice of real soldiers at that day, it
led to several duels.&nbsp; One of them ended fatally, a member
of one of the most respectable families in the town having fallen
by the hand of another, with whom he had always previously been
on the most intimate terms.&nbsp; It was <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>supposed at
the time that this sad affair was encouraged by some who should
have made every exertion and used every effort to have prevented
it, but did not.</p>
<p>We have already spoken of several of the general officers who
commanded in this district at the time we speak of.&nbsp; There
was one, however, who will occupy a larger space in our canvas
than we can afford to give to any other.&nbsp; When our military
enthusiasm was at its height, Prince William Frederick of
Gloucester came down to take the command.&nbsp; It has always
been said that &ldquo;Liverpool loves a lord,&rdquo; and there is
some truth in the sarcasm.&nbsp; You may fancy, then, into what a
fever of loyalty we were all thrown, young as well as old, by the
presence of a prince of the blood royal amongst us, the veritable
nephew of &ldquo;the good old king,&rdquo; George the
Third.&nbsp; And then how that fever grew and inflamed into
actual white heat when the Duke of Gloucester, the king&rsquo;s
brother and the father of the prince, arrived on a visit to his
son.&nbsp; We remember him as if it were but yesterday; a fine,
benevolent-looking old man, who was all smiles and kindness as he
spoke to you.&nbsp; The prince himself was a tall, handsome,
noble-looking young man, not too clever, as some of his intimates
whispered, as they profanely called him &ldquo;Silly
Billy,&rdquo; the name having been originally fastened upon him
by his royal cousin, subsequently George the Fourth, of splendid
and dissipated memory.&nbsp; But what of that?&nbsp; We did not
want him to set the Mersey on fire, but to fight if fighting were
to become necessary.&nbsp; And O! what gaieties, what parties,
what festivities, what flirtations, we had <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>in honour of
his arrival and residence amongst us.&nbsp; Beauty was beauty in
those days, and so the prince thought, and so did the train of
gallant and glorious staff-officers who accompanied him.&nbsp;
There was the magnificent Mrs. &mdash;, and the pretty Mrs.
&mdash;, and the clever Mrs. &mdash;, and the splendid-looking
Miss &mdash;.&nbsp; How other hearts beat, perhaps with jealousy,
perhaps with spite, as the prince, at most of the gay parties,
generally devoted himself, more or less, to one or other of these
Lancashire witches.&nbsp; Occasionally, however, a fit of
formality came over him, and then nothing could be so stupid as
to have the honour of meeting him.&nbsp; The duke, his father,
had not married a bit of German silver, but had followed the bent
of his inclinations and united himself to an English lady of
great beauty.&nbsp; This led to the passing of the Royal Marriage
Act.&nbsp; To annoy the prince, under these circumstances, his
cousins used to raise a question occasionally whether he should
be called Highness or Royal Highness, although there was no doubt
that the latter was his title.&nbsp; This made him ever and anon
tenacious of the amount of honour and respect to be paid to him,
and when the fit was upon him, he would push etiquette to the
extreme, and keep the whole company standing in his presence,
just as another prince does sometimes at the present day.&nbsp;
But when he did relax, he could be a delightful companion.&nbsp;
He possessed prodigious strength, and was very fond of displaying
it at those times when he forgot his stiffness and starch.&nbsp;
There was, however, one sad interruption to the worship and
adoration with which he had <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>hitherto been surrounded in
Liverpool.&nbsp; The Prince of Wales (George the Fourth) and the
Duke of Clarence (the sailor king) paid a visit to &ldquo;the
good old town.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the stars twinkle not before the
moon, and the moon herself pales before the brighter beams of the
sun, so certain of our tuft-hunters here forgot the respect which
was due and which they had long paid to the prince, in their
anxiety to bow down and render homage to the new and passing
visitors.&nbsp; We are not going to recount all the follies of
the occasion.&nbsp; How the Duke of Clarence pushed a milk-pail
from a poor girl&rsquo;s head, in Water-street, and then
astonished her with a guinea for her loss, and so forth.&nbsp; We
shall hasten at once to a scene which took place at the Town
Hall.&nbsp; A magnificent banquet was given there by the Mayor of
the time being.&nbsp; The Prince of Wales, the Duke of Clarence,
Prince William Frederick of Gloucester, the Earls of Derby and
Sefton, with a crowd of military officers, were present.&nbsp;
After dinner the usual toasts were proposed; then the Prince of
Wales and the Duke of Clarence, each with three times
three.&nbsp; At last it was Prince William&rsquo;s turn, when,
under the influence of some demon of mischief, the Mayor, instead
of proposing his health, as usual, with all his titles and all
the honours, foolishly consulted the Prince of Wales and the Duke
of Clarence on the subject, asking in what form he should give
the toast, and whether he should say Highness or Royal
Highness.&nbsp; The answer of the Prince of Wales was said to be,
&ldquo;Certainly not Royal Highness, and without the
honours,&rdquo; while the <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Duke of Clarence more bluntly
replied, &ldquo;D&mdash; him, don&rsquo;t give him at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Mayor then rose and simply proposed,
&ldquo;The commander-in-chief of the District, Prince William
Frederick of Gloucester.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was drunk in solemn
silence.&nbsp; The company all looked grave, as feeling that,
under the influence of a higher idolatry, a gross insult had been
offered to the late god of Liverpool adoration.&nbsp; Fierce
glances were exchanged between the staff-officers and the other
military men present.&nbsp; The prince himself writhed under the
stroke, like a wounded tiger smarting under the lance of the
hunter.&nbsp; Fire and brimstone and the devil himself flashed
from his eyes, but he kept his seat.&nbsp; Presently the fearful
and appalling silence was broken by the voice of the Mayor,
calling out, as the next toast, &ldquo;The lord-lieutenant of the
county, with three times three,&rdquo; the three times three
omitted at the name of the commander-in-chief, being revived with
that of the next toast.&nbsp; A thunderbolt falling into the
midst of the party could not have caused more astonishment and
excitement.&nbsp; There could be no mistake now.&nbsp; The insult
was meant to be an insult, and nothing but an open, prominent,
and most insulting insult.&nbsp; The words had hardly passed from
the lips of the Mayor, when Prince William, glancing a signal to
his staff, who had their eyes fixed upon him, rose from his seat
and left the room, followed not only by them, but by the whole of
the military officers of his command who were present, leaving
the table almost deserted, the Mayor gaping in amazement, and the
royal cousins astounded at the spirit which they <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>had evoked,
more, perhaps, in mischief than in wanton insolence.&nbsp;
However that may have been, from that day forth there was an
uncomfortable feeling between the people of Liverpool and Prince
William.&nbsp; It is only just to the rest of the corporation and
to the gentry of the place to state, that to a man they felt
strongly that an unwarrantable insult had been offered to
him.&nbsp; He was, we believe, persuaded of this, but he never
could be cordial again.&nbsp; If he forgave, he could not forget,
the slight and mortification to which he had been so publicly
exposed.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='W' title='W' src='images/dc6.jpg' />e have
already said that, in the days of which we are speaking, the
Cheshire side of the Mersey, now bridged to us by steam, was a
<i>terra incognita</i> to the general inhabitants of
Liverpool.&nbsp; Almost as little was known of Aigburth,
Childwall, Knotty Ash, Walton, West Derby, and so forth.&nbsp;
Our fashionables were then satisfied to live in their comfortable
town residences, without looking upon a country house and garden,
and hothouse, as necessary to their existence.&nbsp; And we
question whether they were not as happy as, we are certain they
were more sociable and hospitable than, their more refined and
degenerate children.&nbsp; We had not so many sets, cliques, and
coteries.&nbsp; Men were more sincere than flashy in those times,
and their entertainments more solid than showy.&nbsp; But we must
not omit to give a &ldquo;local habitation and a name&rdquo; to
some of our old leaders.&nbsp; The Hollinsheads lived then, and
for many a day after, in the big family house near the
canal.&nbsp; Some few respectable families lingered in
Oldhall-street, to which the venerable Mrs. Linacre, who lived
through so many generations, stuck to the last.&nbsp; Mr.
Drinkwater, the father of Sir <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>George, inhabited a large house in
Water-street.&nbsp; Jonas Bold lived splendidly at the lower end
of Redcross-street.&nbsp; The market at that period was held
round St. George&rsquo;s church, and chiefly in the space then
contracted by a row of houses standing between it and the
Crescent, in the rear of which stood a narrow, winding street,
called Castle Ditch, communicating with Lord-street, then very
narrow, and with no pretentions to attract admiration or even
notice from the casual passenger, although the shops in it were
always among the best in the town.&nbsp; In Church-street lived
the old and respectable family of the Cases, now represented by
Mr. J.D. Case, formerly a member of our town council, and at
present a resident in Cheshire.&nbsp; His father, George Case,
was for many years the leader of the Tory party in the ancient
town council, and was, without exception, the best chairman of a
public meeting whom we ever met with.&nbsp; Clayton-square was a
strong resort of our leading and substantial merchants.&nbsp;
Many a happy day have we spent in what was then the splendid
mansion of the Rodie family.&nbsp; Kind, magnificent, and
munificent in their hospitalities, but now, alas, without a
representative of even the name surviving.&nbsp; Dr. Currie, so
celebrated in his day, and so celebrated yet, lived in
Basnett-street.</p>
<p>Bold-street had its Tobins, Aspinalls, Dawsons, etc.&nbsp;
That kind-hearted man, Rector Renshaw, lived here in a corner
house, with its door opening upon Newington-bridge.&nbsp; A
little farther, on the opposite side, was the house of the famous
John Foster, the most influential, <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>as he assuredly was the cleverest,
man of his day; the father of the generation who have lived and
died amongst us, abused, every one of them, for their name, but
admitted, all and each, to have been gifted men in their several
callings and professions.&nbsp; Opposite to the house of Rector
Renshaw was that of Harry Park, as we familiarly called him, the
Abernethy or Astley Cooper of Liverpool; as a surgeon, we
believe, second to no man of his day.&nbsp; At the very next door
lived Dr. Brandreth, of whose eminence, or pre-eminence, as a
physician, it is impossible to speak too highly.&nbsp; In all our
wanderings over, and sojournings in, different parts of the
world, we never remember to have met with a medical man whose
standing was so thoroughly ascertained, admitted, and
appreciated.&nbsp; And his position was as elevated in the social
as in the medical world.&nbsp; There was no appeal against the
fiats which Fashion issued from her seat in Bold-street.&nbsp; We
now come to Slater-street, then only partially built upon.&nbsp;
Here lived the Myers family, and here resided Mr. Tobin&mdash;at
a much later period, Sir John.</p>
<p>In Seel-street was Mr. Perry, the first dentist of his day and
locality; and next door to him lived the tremendous Mrs. Oates,
the best instructress of small children in the rudiments of
English whom the world has ever seen.&nbsp; She had the knack of
measuring baby capacity, and of drawing out all that it
contained, helped thereto, doubtless, by a concentrated essence
of birch-rod-look which she constantly wore in school-hours, and
which had &ldquo;no mistake&rdquo; written upon it <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>in large
letters.&nbsp; At all events, her name was celebrated at that day
in all our public schools, as the best grounder and trainer of
the young idea from whom they ever received recruits.&nbsp; But
now we are in Duke-street, one of the most fashionable streets in
the town at that remote period, and for some years
afterwards.&nbsp; Here lived Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Peter
Ellames.&nbsp; A little higher up resided a glorious old soul,
Mr., afterwards Sir William Barton, as hearty a true Briton as
ever walked on shoe-leather, and who had many experiences to tell
of the West Indies in general, and Barbadoes in particular; and
many also were the jokes tossed off at his expense.&nbsp; There
used to be a nigger song quoted against him, extemporised by the
black poets, it was said, on some occasion when he had lost a
horse-race in Barbadoes.&nbsp; Some of the jingling rhymes we
recollect ran thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Massa Barton, Massa Barton, we are sorry
for your loss;<br />
But when you run again you must get a better oss!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then, as they rushed away at his supposed angry approach,
came&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Run
boys, run, run for your life,<br />
For here comes Massa Barton with his stick and knife.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a later period, when Sir William was mayor, a very
laughable occurrence took place at his own table.&nbsp; A
gentleman, rising to propose his worship&rsquo;s health, thus
commenced his speech, &ldquo;Addressing myself to you,
sir,&rdquo; etc., but it so happened that Sir William, who was no
enemy to a jolly full bottle, or two if you like, was, by this
time, in a tolerably muddy, misty, <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>and oblivious state of mind, having
no tangible recollections at the moment, save and except of his
Barbadian experiences, where &ldquo;you sir&rdquo; was the term
of contempt used by the master to the slave.&nbsp; Up jumped his
worship, his eyes sparkling with wine and wrath, and with much
hiccuping, exclaimed, &ldquo;You sir, you sir, good heavens, you
sir, that I should have lived to be called you sir!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then down he bumped, looking like Mars, Bacchus, Apollo, rolled
all into one, but continuing to start up and interjectionally to
shout, &ldquo;You sir!&rdquo; until he fell asleep and slipped
under the table.&nbsp; Nobody, however, laughed more heartily the
next morning at the scene than did the mayor himself, who had
returned from Barbadoes to Duke-street.</p>
<p>A few doors from Barton lived John Bridge Aspinall, a man much
esteemed by all in his day, princely in his hospitalities, and
with a heart and hand open to every call of charity.&nbsp; Then
came Leather, Naylor, Black, Penkett, and a crowd of solid and
substantial men, much looked up to and regarded at that
time.&nbsp; But whose noble mansion have we here?&nbsp; Built by
one of the Lake family, it was subsequently, for many years, the
residence of a townsman whose name was identified with Liverpool,
and who, comparatively speaking, but lately departed from amongst
us.&nbsp; We talk of John Bolton, a man who worked his own way up
from poverty to riches, and then lived in the most magnificent
way, and in so becoming a manner that he might have been born to
the magnificence in which he lived.&nbsp; No one knew the value
of silence better than <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>Mr. Bolton.&nbsp; He had not received
much education, but he saved appearances by making it an
invariable rule never to open his mouth on a subject he did not
understand.&nbsp; But we must stop to-day in the catalogue of our
worthies.&nbsp; It may sound to some of our young readers like a
dry chronicle of names.&nbsp; But never mind them.&nbsp; There
are still some old stagers, like ourselves, left, and they will
be delighted with this flight back to the men and things of their
youthful days.&nbsp; Like veterans, we still love the clash of
arms, and to fight our battles over again; and we much mistake if
Liverpool were not at least as remarkable then for its guiding
and leading spirits as it is now.</p>
<h2><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dc7.jpg' /> little
higher up than Colonel Bolton&rsquo;s, but on the same side of
Duke-street, stood the noble palace mansion of Moses Benson, one
of the merchant princes of the old times of which we are
speaking, with its gardens and pleasure grounds, bounded on one
side by Cornwallis-street, and on the other by Kent-street, and
extending backwards to St. James-street.&nbsp; In Duke-street
also lived his son, Ralph Benson, one of the pleasantest and most
agreeable men we ever met with, but somewhat, indeed, too much of
a Lothario.&nbsp; After his father&rsquo;s death he resided at
Lutwyche, in Shropshire, became connected with the turf, and
represented Stafford in several parliaments.&nbsp; His wife, Mrs.
Ralph Benson, was an Irish lady, of good family,&mdash;a Ross
Lewin, we believe,&mdash;a charming person, handsome, and
accomplished, who gave delightful parties, where all the wits and
fashionables of the day used to assemble.&nbsp; And here we must
say that the beaux of those times were beaux indeed.&nbsp; There
are none such to be met with at the Wellington-rooms now, or seen
at the windows of the Palatine Club.&nbsp; The Littledales,
Hamiltons, Duncans, Dawsons, Lakes, etc., of that <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>generation,&mdash;where are they now?&mdash;were then a
list of fine young fellows.&nbsp; And all the parties were so set
off by the red jackets and blue jackets of our brave defenders,
who made strange havoc among the ladies&rsquo; hearts.&nbsp;
Among the staff-officers who figured at them all, how well we
remember the names and faces of Moultrie, Cox, Oisted, Higgins,
and a host of others.&nbsp; And let us not forget the naval
aid-de-camp of the Duke of Gloucester, Captain Browne, whose fine
manly bearing and noble person must still be impressed upon the
memories of many of our older readers.&nbsp; He was a true
specimen of the British sailor, deeply respected by all who knew
him, as well by landsmen as in naval circles.&nbsp; A generation
later, if we may take such a jump, we had, among the
staff-officers quartered here, Bainbrigge, now a general, and one
of the ablest officers in the service, and one of the cleverest
men out of it.&nbsp; There was Peddie, also, a delightful man
among those with whom he was intimate.&nbsp; Nor must we forget
William, we should say Major William, Brackenbury, a charming
fellow, as the ladies said, and a rattling, pleasant, agreeable
companion, as all admitted, the life and charm of every party,
equal to a good song, and foremost in the dance.&nbsp; But what
miracles does time work!&nbsp; Major Brackenbury, and his
charger, and his dashing uniform, and his waving plume left
Liverpool, and we lost sight of him for a long season.&nbsp;
Years elapsed, when we went on a visit to a friend, who lived in
a remote village in a far-off corner of the country.&nbsp; One
day two strangers were announced.&nbsp; They were a <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>deputation
from some missionary society, and had come to invite our host to
attend a meeting to be held that evening at the village
schoolroom.&nbsp; They were grave looking persons; hair combed
down, black coats, white ties, and all the rest of it.&nbsp; As
they entered, we were sure that we had seen the countenance of
one of them before.&nbsp; We looked at him, and he looked at
us.&nbsp; The recognition was mutual, and at the same
instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Jove, Brackenbury,&rdquo; said we.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah, &mdash;!&rdquo; exclaimed he, not less warmly, but
less profanely; and in an instant, after a hearty hand-shaking,
we went back at rattling railway pace to the old times, the old
people, and the old memories, to the bewilderment of both of our
friends, but clearly to the utter horror of his grave
companion.&nbsp; But we could not stop till we had it all out,
nor till then could we proceed to business.&nbsp; He died soon
afterwards.&nbsp; Poor fellow! he was a good soldier in his
soldier days.&nbsp; And his closing career was that of a good
Christian.&nbsp; Peace to his memory!&nbsp; And when we go, may
those who survive us be able to say the same of us.</p>
<p>But to return to our story.&nbsp; In Duke-street, from which
he subsequently removed to Walton Hall, at that time likewise
lived Thomas Leyland, the eminent banker, who, from small
beginnings, worked his way, by energy, industry, and
perseverance, to the possession of immense wealth.&nbsp; He was a
man of amazing shrewdness, sagacity, and prudence.&nbsp; When the
north countryman was asked for the receipt of his ale, which was
always good, he answered, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just a way of <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>doing it,
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so it was with Mr. Leyland.&nbsp; He had
&ldquo;just the way of doing things.&rdquo;&nbsp; We will not
compare him to the animals which are said &ldquo;to see the
wind,&rdquo; but, by some intuition, instinct, or presentiment,
call it what you will, he seemed always to have a warning of any
coming storm in the money market, and trimmed and steered the
ship, and took in sail accordingly.&nbsp; He was a fine-looking
man, with what some thought a stern and forbidding, but what we
should call a firm and decided look.&nbsp; We remember him with
favour and gratitude.&nbsp; We received many civilities, and not
a few substantial kindnesses, from him in his day.&nbsp; We
omitted to state that what is now the Waterloo hotel, <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a> at the bottom of Ranelagh-street, was
then the mansion of the Staniforth family.&nbsp; The son, Samuel,
lived to be an old man amongst us, and was once the mayor of
Liverpool, and afterwards sunk down into being the stamp
distributor of the district.&nbsp; He was a gentlemanly kind of
person in society, but of a strangely austere and forbidding
aspect, the most vinegar-visaged man we ever beheld.&nbsp; And
the index was a correct representative of the inner man.&nbsp;
When the election poet wrote of him &ldquo;Sulky Sam
Staniforth,&rdquo; he drew his character in those three
words.&nbsp; By his marriage with a most estimable lady, he was
closely connected with the Case, Littledale, and Bolton
families.&nbsp; His son came in for the great bulk of Colonel
Bolton&rsquo;s wealth, to the exclusion of his own relations; one
of the happily rare instances in which a north countryman forgets
his own blood in the disposal of his property.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>We now
approach Colquitt-street, in which resided that shrewd, plodding
merchant, Gilbert Henderson, the father of our respected and able
Recorder.&nbsp; Here, also, lived Thomas Parr, who afterwards
retired into Shropshire.&nbsp; His house was disposed of by a
tontine, and, at a later day, became the Royal Institution, from
which so many youths have gone forth to encounter the storms or
pluck the honours of the world.&nbsp; Here, likewise, lived that
true-hearted man of the old school, Peter Whitfield Brancker, one
of the worthiest among the worthies of the days we write
of.&nbsp; He was one who eschewed anything like nonsense, and was
highly gifted with common sense.&nbsp; What he said he meant, and
what he did he did with all his heart and soul.&nbsp; Few thought
that he had so much kindness beneath his somewhat blunt and bluff
bearing; and many called him selfish, when he laid up for his
family what others threw away upon vanity and ostentation.&nbsp;
We always looked upon him as one of the best men of the day; and,
although he was a silent man in general company, he was far
before most of our merchant princes in reading and intellectual
attainments.&nbsp; In Rodney-street, then only partially built
upon, lived Mr. Leicester, and also that &ldquo;fine old English
gentleman,&rdquo; Pudsey Dawson, who was the delight of our
boyhood, as we listened to his powers of talking, and watched,
with amazement, his capabilities for taking snuff.&nbsp; He was
the father of, we may say, besides his other sons, a race of
heroes.&nbsp; William, who was in the Royal Navy, distinguished
himself greatly in the East Indies, by the capture, after a
desperate action, <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>of a French frigate, which had long been an annoyance
and a thorn in the side of our trade in that quarter.&nbsp;
Another fell, gloriously, in Spain.&nbsp; Charles, a lamb in
society, a lion in battle, was killed at Waterloo.&nbsp; If our
memory holds good, both of these last mentioned were then in the
52nd, a crack regiment in the famous fighting brigade of those
gunpowder times.&nbsp; Noble old Pudsey Dawson!&nbsp; How he
would talk by the hour, of wars and rumours of wars, to the
circle which would gather round him at the Athen&aelig;um, until,
as he turned from one to another, the whole ring in which he
moved might be tracked by the overflow of his snuff-box.&nbsp;
And what a horror he had of Napoleon and Frenchmen and everything
French.&nbsp; It was well for them, as he used to say, that he
was not at Blucher&rsquo;s elbow when he entered Paris, it being
his firm belief that the earth would never be quiet, until that
city of trouble and confusion was blotted from its face.&nbsp;
But Liverpool society could not point to a man of whom it was
prouder, or one more respected, esteemed, or honoured, than this
same Pudsey Dawson.&nbsp; All men liked him, and we did not make
an exception.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='I' title='I' src='images/dc8.jpg' />n
Rodney-street, likewise, lived Fletcher Raincock, one of the most
remarkable characters of his day.&nbsp; He had few equals in a
legal capacity, and no superiors in literary attainments.&nbsp;
He had a most gluttonous appetite for books, and read everything,
old and new.&nbsp; He was a regular &ldquo;curiosity shop&rdquo;
in the variety of his knowledge, and could produce all sorts of
odds and ends at a moment&rsquo;s notice, from all sorts of
ancient authors, unknown to and never heard of by other
people.&nbsp; This made him a most agreeable companion, his
conversational powers being tremendous, and set off, rather than
impaired, by a spice of originality and eccentricity, just enough
to draw a line between him and the common herd of ordinary and
every-day people by whom he was surrounded.&nbsp; Like Yorick,
&ldquo;he would set the table in a roar,&rdquo; by the combined
wit and wisdom which he had ever at command.&nbsp; And while
speaking of lawyers, let us digress for a moment to mention
another old giant of those times.&nbsp; We allude to Mr.
Hargreaves, who was for some years the Recorder of Liverpool, a
deep and profound lawyer, <i>haud ulli veterum virtute
secundus</i>.&nbsp; He was succeeded by James Clarke, who lived
to a much later date amongst <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>us.&nbsp; Poor Clarke!&nbsp; We never
thought him crushed down by the weight of legal lore which he
carried.&nbsp; But he was a man given to books, and had learned
much from them.&nbsp; A pleasant man in a party, too, he was,
abounding in anecdote and the passing stories of the day.&nbsp;
And, on one point, we must admit that he was unmatched.&nbsp; We
never met with any one who possessed more shrewdness and
knowledge of the world.&nbsp; He had thoroughly studied the
volume of man as well as printed books, and we often point to his
career as a proof of the usefulness of this knowledge.&nbsp; He
had a remarkable coolness and calmness about his character, but
we did once see him put into a regular &ldquo;fix,&rdquo; in his
own court, by an obstreperous juryman, who would have a will of
his own.&nbsp; A huge sailor and a small boy were being tried for
stealing an immense piece of cable.&nbsp; The sailor threw it all
upon the boy, and the Recorder, believing him, was charging the
jury to the same effect, when one of them rising, and hitching up
his trousers, commenced, &ldquo;But, Mr. Recorder!&rdquo;&nbsp;
This was too much.&nbsp; Mr. Recorder, electrified with
indignation at being so interrupted, looked his best thunderbolts
at the remonstrant, who still, however, kept sturdily on his
legs, muttering protests against the opinion of the bench.&nbsp;
The spectators became excited and amused at such an unusual
scene, and a titter went round the court.&nbsp; This only added
fuel to the fire, and Mr. Recorder made another attempt to
silence his persevering assailant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell
you,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;that from the evidence, the boy
must have been the culprit who carried off the cable; <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>the law says
so, and I say so.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the obdurate juryman had not
yet done.&nbsp; He instantly answered, &ldquo;But, Mr. Recorder,
I do not know what you and the law may tell me, but common sense
tells me that that boy could not even lift that piece of cable
from the ground, much less run away with it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was a poser with a vengeance.&nbsp; It was a new and original
view of the case, which set all evidence at naught.&nbsp; The
titter in the court grew into a regular burst of laughter, which
nothing could check.&nbsp; The poor Recorder was fully nonplussed
and nonsuited, and the jury acquitted the boy without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
<p>And here, if we may descend from barristers to solicitors, let
us render a tribute of respect to the memory of a fine old
fellow, a practitioner in the latter branch of the legal
profession.&nbsp; We speak of George Rowe, of whom we knew much,
and nothing but what was admirable.&nbsp; He was a warm friend
and a delightful companion.&nbsp; He loved the good things of
this world, but he liked others to enjoy them with him.&nbsp; He
was fond of society, and in his own house kept, we always
thought, the best table in Liverpool.&nbsp; But we were going to
speak of him as a lawyer.&nbsp; We cannot fathom the exact depth
of his reading in Coke, Blackstone, and so forth.&nbsp; We leave
his head, to speak of his heart.&nbsp; And in this point of view,
we can mention several things which will prove that, unless
lawyers in general are greatly maligned, George Rowe was a
miracle of a lawyer, in allowing the milk of human kindness to
flow so largely through his nature.&nbsp; We recollect an
instance in which he offended and <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>lost an old and valuable client,
because he refused to make a will for him which he thought unjust
towards the gentleman&rsquo;s own family and relations.&nbsp; And
more instances than one could we tell of in which he worked, and
included even expensive papers, documents, and stamps, all
&ldquo;free gratis for nothing,&rdquo; for poor and deserving
parties who had solicited his help in the expectation that they
were to pay for it on the usual terms.&nbsp; There may be others
in the profession, and we trust there are many, equally liberal
and kind-hearted.&nbsp; But knowing it of him, we tell it, and we
add further, that, in our voyage of life, we never met a kinder,
a warmer, and a truer friend.&nbsp; We honoured him in life, and
in death we treasure his name and memory.</p>
<p>In Queen-square lived another family, called, with a different
spelling, Roe, and of most respectable standing were they, among
the substantial old stagers of the town.&nbsp; In the same
locality resided Colonel Graham, and also another party upon whom
we must bestow a somewhat longer notice.&nbsp; This was Mr. John
Shaw, commonly called Jack Shaw, a man of immense wealth and
intense vulgarity.&nbsp; Never was there such a sacrifice to the
golden calf as that betrayed, not simply by the elevation of such
a person to the highest municipal honours, and the civic chair,
but in giving him an influence which he held undisturbed for
years.&nbsp; He was positively known by the sobriquet of
&ldquo;the King of the Council,&rdquo; or &ldquo;King
Jack.&rdquo;&nbsp; His grammar was truly <i>&agrave; la</i>
Malaprop.&nbsp; On one occasion we recollect hearing him, when
wishing to be fine, call the old <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>constables his
&ldquo;mermaids,&rdquo; instead of his
&ldquo;myrmidons.&rdquo;&nbsp; At another time, when he was
sitting on the bench, the Town-clerk observed to him that a
sentence which he was about to pass would be contrary to the Act
of Parliament, when the magisterial despot silenced his
functionary by retorting, &ldquo;D&mdash; your Acts of
Parliament.&nbsp; What cares I for your Acts of
Parliament?&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a habit also of invariably
pronouncing the word &ldquo;digest&rdquo; as if it were
&ldquo;disgust.&rdquo;&nbsp; One day, at his own table, he had a
waggish friend of his, Carruthers, dining with him.&nbsp; The
fish was not very good, as Jack always dealt in the cheapest
market.&nbsp; Carruthers rather turned up his nose at the savour,
but his host fell to with the greatest vigour, observing,
&ldquo;Oh, I can disgust anything.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, by
&mdash;, that you can,&rdquo; exclaimed C., with a roaring
laugh.&nbsp; Presently, however, Jack paid him off, as he
thought, with compound interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Carruthers, my boy,
how many shirts a week do you wear?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;One every day, and sometimes more,&rdquo; was the
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, man,&rdquo; was Jack&rsquo;s rejoinder,
&ldquo;what a dirty hide you must have.&nbsp; One serves me a
fortnight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such were the municipal pleasantries of
the municipal monarch of his day.&nbsp; We believe that it was
the same worthy potentate who once threatened to
&ldquo;<i>slat</i> an inkstand at the head of a Jew, who was a
witness before him, if he did not tell him what his Christian
name was,&rdquo; and he would have said the same thing to a Turk
or a Hindoo.</p>
<p>We believe it was the same Jack who once complained to the
late Egerton Smith that he had not <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>reported something that he had said
fairly, when that respected editor facetiously replied, that
&ldquo;if he ever grumbled again, he would report everything he
uttered on the bench or elsewhere, <i>verbatim et literatim</i>,
exactly as he delivered it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But our readers must not
suppose that because, by some strange metamorphosis more
wonderful than any related by Ovid, this awful Jack was
translated into a Town-Councilman, we had, therefore, a whole
council of such men.&nbsp; Far from it.&nbsp; Jack was a pelican
in the wilderness, a thing out of place, an accidental nuisance,
how and why admitted into that body, it is impossible now even to
guess.&nbsp; As a whole, and with this exception, the old Town
Council of Liverpool consisted of some of the first and most
respectable and most respected men in the place.&nbsp; Its fault
was, that it was too exclusive; like the late Whig cabinet, too
much of a family affair.&nbsp; It did its work well in its day;
we may, indeed, say remarkably well, considering its
irresponsibility.&nbsp; But a change was demanded with the
changing times.&nbsp; We sometimes question, however, whether we
have improved the class of men.&nbsp; Then it was selection,
without election; now it is too often election, without
selection.&nbsp; But the present system has this great advantage:
a black sheep is not a perpetuity.&nbsp; We can get rid of him at
the end of his three years, and that is something, and a great
something.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='I' title='I' src='images/dc9.jpg' />n Mount
Pleasant lived, in those good old times, Sir George Dunbar, the
representative of an ancient race in Scotland, and a model
gentleman, both in appearance and manners.&nbsp; He was
originally in business in Liverpool; but when the family title
descended to him, the pride of ancestry was stronger than the
pride of &ldquo;the merchant prince&rdquo; within him, and he
retired from vulgar trade, cut sugar hogsheads and rum puncheons,
and was no more seen on the &ldquo;Rialto,&rdquo; discussing
markets and inquiring the price of barilla and pearl ashes.&nbsp;
It was a false move on the part of the worthy baronet. No rank
would have been sullied by remaining in the firm of which he was
the head.&nbsp; His junior partners, Ewart and Rutson, became not
only eminent, but pre-eminent, amongst our giants of that day,
and achieved a name and reputation known to the ends of the
earth, and are still well represented amongst us.&nbsp; The son
of the latter is a large landowner in Yorkshire, universally
respected; while, of the family of the former, one son, William,
has long been in parliament, and another, Joseph Christopher, was
a candidate for <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Liverpool at a recent general election.&nbsp; But the
Dunbars have altogether vanished from the scene.&nbsp; The best
of them that we knew, poor Tom Dunbar, was one of the handsomest
and cleverest, and certainly the most brilliant and the wittiest,
of mankind.&nbsp; He had abilities for anything, for everything,
but he never cultivated them; at all events, he never used
them.&nbsp; He wanted either application or resolution.&nbsp; It
might be the pride of his father in another shape.&nbsp; He was a
lounger where he might have been a leader.&nbsp; He was satisfied
to flash and dazzle as a meteor in society, while men much less
intellectually endowed, but of a more persevering and plodding
spirit, passed over him, and became persons of mark, position,
and distinction.&nbsp; It was mortifying to his friends to see
him ever with the game in his hands, yet always throwing up the
cards.&nbsp; His active life amounted to just <i>nil</i>; but his
sayings, his polished witticisms, his delightful retorts, his
splendid and pungent repartees, in English, Greek, and Latin,
would fill volumes.&nbsp; They are still treasured by the
survivors of the circle of which he was the life and joy and
pride, and brought out every now and then, with a sadly smiling
countenance, as one of Dunbar&rsquo;s gems: just as on high and
grand days we go to the oldest bin for a bottle of the best
vintage.&nbsp; And everything was original with him.&nbsp; He
never borrowed nor repeated.&nbsp; It was fresh and fresh with
him, as often as you met him.</p>
<p>But we must pass on.&nbsp; Russell-street and Clarence-street
had no existence in those days.&nbsp; In St. Anne-Street <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>resided the
old families of Bridge, Fisher, and Rogers.&nbsp; Here also lived
Mr. Blundell, the clergyman; Mr. Smith, at a later period of
Fulwood Lodge; and Mr. Haywood, the father of the eminent
cotton-broker of that name.&nbsp; Close to St. Anne&rsquo;s
Church was the house of a celebrated character amongst us, both
then and long afterwards.&nbsp; We speak of Mr. Thomas Wilson,
profanely called Tommy Wilson, the dancing-master, by his wicked
pupils.&nbsp; A good fellow was Tommy, although a strict
disciplinarian in &ldquo;teaching the young idea,&rdquo; not
&ldquo;how to shoot,&rdquo; but how to turn out its toes and go
through the positions.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, Mr. Wilson grew
too ambitious, and, instead of contenting himself with fiddling
for boys and girls to dance to, would preside over orchestras and
concerts, and cater for the amusement of the public, by which we
fear he did not grow too rich.&nbsp; He was a worthy,
warm-hearted man in his way, and somewhat of an original, and
withal possessing the good opinion of all who knew him.&nbsp; Nor
must we forget to state that in St. Anne-street likewise lived
Mr. Rutson, of whom we have already spoken.&nbsp; His partner,
Mr. Ewart, resided in Birchfield.&nbsp; In Soho-street was the
house of Mr. Butler, somewhat too convivial in his habits, but
one of the most thorough gentlemen we ever met with.&nbsp; His
son is the present Mr. Butler Cole, of Cote and Kirkland Halls,
both in this county.&nbsp; In Rose-place, then a fashionable
suburb, more country than town, resided Mr. Lake, who
subsequently retired to Birkenhead Priory, and afterwards to
Castle Godwyn, in Gloucestershire.&nbsp; He was the <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>father of the
Captain Lake whose wound from a Mini&eacute; rifle, at Weedon,
was recently mentioned in the newspapers.&nbsp; A little further
out towards the green fields, now all streets, we come to the
mansion of a noble old worthy of those times, Edward Houghton,
the father of Richard and Raymond, of &ldquo;that ilk,&rdquo; so
well known and so much respected amongst us.&nbsp; How well we
remember his amiable and benevolent countenance!&nbsp; He had a
kind word for everybody, and was prompt to do kind acts
too.&nbsp; And what a staunch sportsman he was, seldom missing
his bird, and devoted to his work.&nbsp; And then what a famous
breed of pointers he had, jet black and all black.&nbsp; How they
would set and back set.&nbsp; How they would range the stubble
and never flush a partridge nor run a hare.&nbsp; How they would
&ldquo;down charge&rdquo; at the sound of a gun, without a word
being said.&nbsp; We wonder whether any of the descendants of
this celebrated race of dogs are yet in being.</p>
<p>But, before we pass beyond the boundaries of the old borough,
let us hark back a little, and enumerate a few more of the
ancient worthies, or &ldquo;standards,&rdquo; of the town whom we
have omitted in the foregoing catalogue.&nbsp; There were the
Boardman, Harding, Bancroft, Downward, and Lorimer
families.&nbsp; Nor must we forget to mention that admiration of
our boyhood, William Peatt Litt.&nbsp; He always seemed to us to
be the original of the lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Old King Cole was a jolly old soul,<br />
And a jolly old soul was he.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>A
munificent, magnificent, generous, hospitable soul indeed was Mr.
Litt.&nbsp; There are few like him now.&nbsp; And there were
several families of the Byroms.&nbsp; The Naylors and Bournes,
the grandfathers of the present generation of those names, lived
in Duke-street, and were among the most respectable and respected
of our citizens.&nbsp; There, also, lived Mr. Patrick Black, a
fine old stager even at the time we speak of.&nbsp; We can see
him yet before us.&nbsp; Picture to yourselves a kind and
venerable man, in a cloak enveloping his whole body from head to
foot, a gold-headed cane in his hand, and a wig.&nbsp; Oh! such a
wig, a regular wig of wigs, as white as the whitest of
hair-powder could make it, of a transcendental cauliflower
appearance, and in size far beyond the proportions of the largest
Sunday wig assigned to Dr. Johnson in the pictures which have
come down to us.&nbsp; We recollect once, when about some six
years old, getting into an awful scrape about this said venerable
gentleman and his megatherium wig.&nbsp; We were walking with a
small friend of our own age and inches, when suddenly the
apparition of Mr. Patrick Black, arrayed as we have described
him, came in sight.&nbsp; Our admiration, as usual, burst forth
in the far from respectful and almost profane exclamation,
&ldquo;There goes old Black with his white wig.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Hardly were the words out of our mouth, when a gentle tap came
upon our shoulders, and a soft whisper fell upon our ear,
&ldquo;Master &mdash;, if it would be any particular pleasure to
you, I will ask my father to wear a black wig in
future.&rdquo;&nbsp; We looked round, and, O! horror of horrors!
were we not thrown into real <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>agonies, and almost hysterics, when,
in the person uttering this mild remonstrance, we recognised the
daughter of the old gentleman whose wig we had been
blaspheming?&nbsp; We stammered and hammered at an excuse, and
then ran for our life.&nbsp; And for many a long day we
disappeared round the nearest corner as quickly as possible if
any of the Black family came in sight of us in our walks.&nbsp;
The joke, however, got wind, and it was long before our martyrdom
and persecution ceased, even in our own circle, where &ldquo;Old
Black with his white wig&rdquo; was thrown into our teeth
whenever we were inclined to be obstreperous and naughty.&nbsp;
Neither must we forget the name of Brian Smith, who lived in
Bold-street, and whose very look was a picture of
benevolence.&nbsp; John Leigh, too, the attorney, a man of
gravity and silence, but with a very intelligent countenance,
lived then in Basnett-street.&nbsp; As we shall have occasion to
mention his name in a future chapter, we shall merely allude to
it here.&nbsp; And there was the firm of M&rsquo;Iver,
M&rsquo;Viccar, and M&rsquo;Corquodale, never mentioned by us
youngsters without the addition of the awfully bad joke about the
old woman, a mythological old woman doubtless, going into their
office and asking if they were the house of M&rsquo;Viper,
M&rsquo;Adder, and M&rsquo;Crocodile.</p>
<p>But who is this &ldquo;Goliath of Gath&rdquo; whom we see
approaching, and whom, if he had lived in these days and been a
poor man, Barnum would certainly have bagged, and caravaned, and
made a fortune out of as a giant?&nbsp; It is Roger Leigh, as
kind-hearted a man as ever lived, with an amiable and benevolent
smile ever <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>playing upon and irradiating his huge countenance.&nbsp;
He was a general favourite, as he walked amongst us like Gulliver
among the Lilliputians.&nbsp; And what a character he was at an
election!&nbsp; His activity and energy in such times were
tremendous.&nbsp; But Roger was rather a paradox in his
politics.&nbsp; A Roman Catholic in his religion, he was what was
then called &ldquo;a Church and King man&rdquo; to the backbone;
a Tory of Tories, in days when Tories were not the faint-hearted
chickens which we now see them.&nbsp; Poor old Roger Leigh!&nbsp;
Like Sir Abel Handy, he had always some scheme on the anvil for
getting rich, but we fear that, like the rest of us, he sometimes
took two steps backward for one forward.&nbsp; The stone of
Sisyphus is the type of most of us.&nbsp; But, rich or poor,
successful or otherwise, peace to his memory!&nbsp; We never
heard harm of him.&nbsp; He had everybody&rsquo;s good
word.&nbsp; We wish that the world contained many more like
him.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='H' title='H' src='images/dc10.jpg' />e who
undertakes to be the chronicler of Liverpool society at the
commencement, and in the early years, of the present century,
must not forget to mention the old and respectable families of
Gildart and Golightly. And who is this easy, good-tempered soul,
whom the mind&rsquo;s eye now brings before us?&nbsp; It is Mr.
William Rigg, profanely called &ldquo;Billy Rigg&rdquo; by his
familiars. And who comes next?&nbsp; Henry Clay, frank, jovial,
light-hearted fellow, once Mayor of Liverpool, and a generous and
hospitable chief magistrate he made. And there goes that
veritable ancient, Arthur Onslow, collector of customs, with a
name which testifies that family interest was as strong in those
days as it is in these.&nbsp; And now, if we go on &rsquo;Change,
surely this is an original whom we see before us.&nbsp; His name
is Brown, but among the gentlemen &ldquo;on the flags&rdquo; he
is better known as &ldquo;Muckle John.&rdquo;&nbsp; A shrewd,
sagacious man of business is he, as ever lived; and many were the
stories which used to be told of his sayings and doings and
somewhat sharp practice in his money transactions.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. So-and-so will be my security to you,&rdquo; said some
gentleman one day to him.&nbsp; <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>&ldquo;Aye, mon, but who will be the
security for the security?&rdquo; was his retort.&nbsp; In after
life we became acquainted with the celebrated &ldquo;Jemmy
Woods,&rdquo; the Gloucester banker, and it always struck us that
he strongly resembled &ldquo;Muckle John&rdquo; in many features
of his character, especially in <i>crescit amor nummi quantum
ipsa pecunia crescit</i>.&nbsp; The cash book seemed to be father
and mother, wife and child, comfort and consolation, joy and
glory of both of them.&nbsp; But we had reached Great
Nelson-street North before we turned back again into the
town.&nbsp; A little further on, in Everton, lived Mr. Thomas
Hinde, second to none here in his day.&nbsp; The representatives
of his family are now to be found at Lancaster.&nbsp; At Everton,
likewise, resided Mr. Shaw, the father of Mr. Thomas Shaw; also
one of the Earle family; another brother lived then, and long
afterwards, at Spekelands.&nbsp; At St. Domingo was the mansion
of Mr. Sparling.&nbsp; The country-houses beyond that were
&ldquo;few and far between.&rdquo;&nbsp; Close to the old
London-road, about two miles from Liverpool, lived Mr. Falkner,
the Major of the Liverpool Light Horse.&nbsp; A mile or two
further out was Oak-hill, the seat of Mr. Joseph Leigh, one of
the most pushing and rich of our enterprising merchants, and as
fine, handsome looking a fellow as you may meet with in a ten
days&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; The march of intellect did not advance
per railway in those times; and Mr. Leigh, although marvellously
at home in arithmetic, compound addition, the rule of three,
multiplication and so forth, had not much studied history,
poetics, and the other graces, and, as by many they were then
thought, <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>exotics of education.&nbsp; Consequently endless were
the stories told of his blunders and mistakes in the literary
line when he crept up in life, and thought it necessary to come
out as a M&aelig;cenas.&nbsp; For instance, it was said that, in
ordering his library, he directed that so many feet of books
should be placed in it, and that, when asked if he would have
them bound in Russia, he answered promptly, &ldquo;No, in
England, to be sure!&rdquo;&nbsp; On one occasion, a waggish
bookseller asserted that he called at his shop and told him that,
as Shakespeare was considered to be such a first-rate writer, he
must send him immediately any more works which he might publish;
while on another, after surveying shelf after shelf covered with
books having Tom. for Vol. inscribed upon their backs, he
exclaimed, in the highest degree of admiration, &ldquo;Upon my
word, that Tom must have been a monstrous clever
fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; We, of course, receive such accounts <i>cum
grano salis</i>, or to speak in more mercantile phrase, with a
little discount, not as absolutely fabulous, but as somewhat
highly coloured.&nbsp; Moreover, we have no doubt that, in
addition to his own blunders, Mr. Leigh was made to bear all
&ldquo;the tales of our grandfathers&rdquo; in previous
circulation.&nbsp; He subsequently removed to Belmont, a splendid
place in Cheshire, when the proud squires of that proud county
took up the ball, and coined and circulated all sorts of odd
tales about him.&nbsp; In their visits, one with another, they
passed from house to house for a week at least, and brought with
them an immense retinue of horses and servants.&nbsp; And it was
a standing joke for years among them, that, when first <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>Mr. Leigh
settled in that part of the country, he told some of them who
called upon him that he should be happy to see them at tea
occasionally.&nbsp; But as we have also heard this story told
against the first Mr. France, of Bostock Hall, who also passed
from Liverpool into Cheshire, it may not have been originally
levelled against Mr. Leigh.&nbsp; Another laugh, however, against
him was, that some village wag, who probably had not been valued
at his own price by some of the new inmates of Belmont, inscribed
over the lodge gates, where they were found one morning, the
following doggerel:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In this house there is no beer,<br />
In this park there are no deer.<br />
And why?&nbsp; Joe Leigh lives here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must, however, recollect that the Cheshire squires had
then, and probably have yet, a strong aversion to Liverpool and
all its works.&nbsp; Looking at their mortgages,&mdash;for in
those days a Cheshire squire without mortgages would have been a
<i>rara avis</i> indeed,&mdash;they had a sort of prophetic
feeling that the merchant princes of Liverpool were destined to
eat them up, like another Canaan; in other words, to buy the
acres of all the wiseacres in the county, and so exterminate the
original squirearchy.&nbsp; <i>Hinc ill&aelig;
lachrym&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; Hence, when they lost the game, they
took their revenge in bad jokes which kill nobody, and, indeed,
are very harmless affairs, if, as the French proverb has it,
<i>Il rit bien qui rit le dernier</i>, he has the best of the
laugh who has the last of it.&nbsp; Mr. Leigh had a <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>brother, a
very quiet and respectable man.&nbsp; He lived in Duke-street at
one time, and afterwards at Roby Hall.</p>
<p>But, in speaking of Everton just now, we forgot to mention
William Harper, one of the wealthiest men of his day, a blunt,
downright sort of person, a member of the old corporation, and
mayor in his turn.&nbsp; He also had made an encroachment on the
pride, and trod on the toes, of the Cheshire squires, by buying
an estate at Davenham, near Northwich.&nbsp; He had three
daughters, co-heiresses, whom, when at school, he never forgot to
toast at his own table as &ldquo;The lasses of
Ashbourn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some people thought this a good joke, and
it was even alluded to in some of the election squibs of the
day.&nbsp; But we always admired the old man for it, and looked
upon it as an excellent trait in his character.&nbsp; One of them
married Mr. Hoskins, or, as he afterwards became, Mr. Hoskins
Harper.&nbsp; Another was Mrs. Formby.&nbsp; The third was united
to Dr. Brandreth, or, as he was called in his father&rsquo;s
lifetime, Dr. Joseph Brandreth, who, in the second generation,
has so well maintained the medical distinction achieved by the
first.</p>
<p>But to return from this digression; not far from Oak-hill was
Highfield, now the seat of that prince of good fellows, Thomas
Littledale, Esq., the chief magistrate of Liverpool, but then
belonging to, and the residence of, the Parke family.&nbsp; A
fine, glorious, jovial old man do we recollect Mr. Parke.&nbsp;
He had three sons, whom we remember; Mr. Thomas Parke, Major
Parke, and a third, of world-wide fame and celebrity, <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Baron Parke,
of whom &ldquo;the gude old town&rdquo; cannot be too proud, as
first and foremost among the legal ornaments of the judicial
bench.</p>
<p>Not far from Highfield was Ashfield House, the mansion of John
Clarke, a brother of the Recorder, and himself a member of the
Town Council, and once Mayor of Liverpool.&nbsp; He was a
peculiarly good-looking little man, always well-dressed, rode a
good horse, and drove a neat carriage.&nbsp; Further on we
arrived at Broad Green, belonging to the Staniforth family.&nbsp;
Mr. Ashton, whose sons and descendants still reside in the
neighbourhood, lived at Wootton, honoured and respected by all
the circle of his friends and acquaintance.&nbsp; At Childwall
was the noble mansion of the Gascoignes, which has now passed
into the hands of the Marquis of Salisbury, who married the only
daughter and heiress of the last possessor, Bamber Gascoigne, who
was at one time, as his ancestors had been before him, the member
for Liverpool.&nbsp; His retired habits, however, and his
literary tastes, interfered with his bringing any very great
portion of activity to his duties, and on one occasion, having
thereby been brought into collision with some of the
merchant-princes amongst his constituents, they renounced their
allegiance to him, but still, not altogether repudiating the
family name, they selected as his successor his younger brother,
the famous General Gascoigne, who, however, was a very inferior
person to Bamber.&nbsp; But we shall come to him presently.&nbsp;
At Childwall likewise resided Thomas Clarke, whose two brothers
we have already mentioned; a <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>man whose good-nature, generosity,
and nobleness of soul have seldom been equalled, never
surpassed.&nbsp; Mr. Clarke had also a splendid place, Peplow
Hall, in Shropshire, now, we rather think, belonging to Lord
Hill.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='L' title='L' src='images/dc11.jpg'
/>iverpool society, like that of every other place, has always
been divided into sets; how formed, by what mysterious line
separated into divisions and sub-divisions, and sections, and
cliques and coteries, we can no more tell than we can explain the
causes at work to produce the eddies of the tide.&nbsp; There
they are, and we must take them as we find them.&nbsp; It is so,
always was so, and ever will be so.&nbsp; But, in enumerating the
old stagers of half-a-century ago, more or less, we have passed
them in review &ldquo;promiscuously, as it were,&rdquo; without
undertaking the invidious task of cataloguing the particular set
to which they individually belonged.&nbsp; Generally speaking,
however, they may be placed under three heads: the fashionable
set, the wealthy and commercial set, and the Corporation
set.&nbsp; But many of those who have been named belonged to all
of these sets.&nbsp; There was, moreover, a literary set; but it
was numerically very small.&nbsp; Its three principal ornaments
were Dr. Currie, Dr. Shepherd and Mr. Roscoe.&nbsp; The latter,
who became so world famous at once, and so deservedly, was a
remarkable and striking instance of <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>the proverbially small estimation in
which prophets are generally held in their own country.&nbsp; It
is true that, by a momentary enthusiasm, he was sent to
parliament to represent his native town.&nbsp; But it was
transient and evanescent, and as speedily burnt out as a fire of
stubble.&nbsp; Liverpool never appreciated Roscoe as the rest of
the world appreciated him, nor does it now appreciate him as the
rest of the world appreciates him, in spite of its feeble talk
about his immortal memory, and its weak and mocking attempts to
support Roscoe clubs.&nbsp; In any other place, his name would
have been what Shakespeare&rsquo;s is to Stratford, &ldquo;a
household word,&rdquo; familiar in the mouth of age, manhood and
childhood.&nbsp; But it is not so here, and with him.&nbsp; He
has a small and decreasing circle of friends, who remember him
when alive, and still treasure every word of wisdom which they
ever heard from his lips.&nbsp; He has a somewhat wider circle of
admirers, who read his works, and find a giant&rsquo;s hand
impressed upon them all.&nbsp; And there are others who profess
to read and admire, because they have learned that no badge of
ignorance would be thought greater in the literary world than a
confession that they have not studied the writings of Roscoe.</p>
<p>But when all these are counted, we still remain convinced that
the general public of Liverpool, beginning from the topmost
pinnacle of its society, possess a marvellously small knowledge,
and as small an appreciation, of the literary remains of this
illustrious man.&nbsp; We can give a remarkable instance of this,
of which probably the generality of our readers have never <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>heard.&nbsp;
Not many years ago, a Liverpool lady, whose literary attainments
are of the highest order, was, when in London, asked to meet a
very select party combining some of the most intellectual, as
well as the most aristocratic, persons of the west end of the
metropolis.&nbsp; She was delighted with the company, and they
were equally delighted with her, with her stores of information,
her lively conversation, her brilliant wit, her sparkling
repartee, the <i>tout ensemble</i> which made her the lion, or,
speaking of a lady, the star of the day.&nbsp; But at last,
unhappily for the moment, the name of Roscoe was mentioned, and
she became astonished, confused, and silent as she heard him
spoken of with an awe, an admiration, and a reverence due and
paid only to minds of the most magnificent calibre.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Take any shape but that,&rdquo; she might have said,
&ldquo;and I can talk with the best here present.&rdquo;&nbsp; On
this topic, however, she was mute, and her perplexity and
annoyance were dreadfully increased when, at every pause, the
rest of the party seemed to wait for her opinions and
sentiments.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was a Lancashire man.&nbsp; He was a
Liverpool man.&nbsp; She must have visited, as the Mahommedan
does his Mecca, with the steps of a pilgrim, every locality
hallowed and consecrated by his presence and footsteps.&nbsp; She
must have treasured and embalmed in her memory anecdotes of his
sayings and doings which had not yet appeared in print; stories
of his habits, and customs, and daily life, which enthusiasm had
cherished and tradition handed down.&rdquo;&nbsp; But they
laboured under a huge delusion.&nbsp; She was no Boswell, <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>to read from
her diary the hourly records of the life of another Dr.
Johnson.&nbsp; In fact, she was ignorant on this point, and knew
nothing of the man of whom they were speaking.</p>
<p>It may be explained.&nbsp; She was of an ultra-Tory family,
with large estates in the West Indies, of which past generations
had run passenger ships for involuntary black emigrants from
Africa to the other side of the Atlantic.&nbsp; In her home
circle, then, as a child, a girl, she had always heard Roscoe
spoken of, not as a great philanthropist, not as a first-rate
scholar, not as a writer whose books will be read and referred to
until the world&rsquo;s last blaze, but as a busy-body, as a
meddler, as a mischief-monger, whose wish and object were to
injure and destroy the town and trade of Liverpool.&nbsp; We may
not wonder then that her amazement was great, and her perplexity
not less, when now, for the first time in her life, she heard
what was the public estimation in which her world-celebrated and
world-appreciated townsman was held.&nbsp; The mists of local
prejudice were at once scattered from before her eyes.&nbsp; She
honestly and candidly took refuge in a confession of the truth,
and so dissipated the half sneer, half smile of wonder which was
gathering on the lips of some of the company.&nbsp; We recollect
the circumstance well, and were not more amused than pleased with
the avidity with which the very next day our fair friend provided
herself with everything written by or of Roscoe, and with the
keenness of appetite with which she set to work to devour them as
speedily as possible.&nbsp; He is now <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>one of the <i>Dii Majores</i> in her
intellectual Pantheon.&nbsp; But we also mentioned Dr. Shepherd,
<i>clarum et venerabile nomen</i>, as one of the literary giants
of our locality some years since.&nbsp; He was, indeed, and no
mistake about it.</p>
<p>We have frequently in our time heard him compared by turns
with Theodore Hook and Sidney Smith.&nbsp; But he was, in our
opinion, infinitely superior to either of those luminaries in the
Metropolitan world of wit; and, had he shone in the same sky, our
belief is that their lesser rays would have paled before his
greater brilliancy, as the stars go out and tapers glow dull and
dim when the sun is up and dazzling us with his glory.&nbsp; Dr.
Shepherd was a thorough and solid scholar; an advantage not
possessed by either of his rivals.&nbsp; Hook&rsquo;s education
was notoriously deficient.&nbsp; Smith had not accumulated equal
stores of learning from his.&nbsp; Hook, when not running riot as
a <i>rou&eacute;</i>, a debauchee, mad with dissipation, and
intoxicated with the flattery of the circle in which he moved,
never soared to anything beyond the character of a first class
Jack Pudding.&nbsp; His practical jokes were those of a boy
blackguard.&nbsp; His jokes uttered were almost invariably of the
coarsest kind, which derived a momentary zest and relish, not
from their own intrinsic value, but from the political excitement
which then prevailed, and which they were generally intended to
subserve.&nbsp; Friendship has indeed sought, in more than one
biography, to rescue him from such a character.&nbsp; But
friendship would have been more friendly, so to speak, if it
would have allowed him to be forgotten.&nbsp; <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>There is no
advocate so eloquent as oblivion for some reputations.&nbsp; With
Sidney Smith, again, it was &ldquo;Figaro here, Figaro there,
Figaro everywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; His whole life was one long,
enduring, universal jest.</p>
<p>He never seems to have been serious.&nbsp; In all his
conversations, and most of his writings, puns and points, often
not soaring to sparkling antithesis or dazzling epigram, beset
you, like &ldquo;man traps and spring guns,&rdquo; at every turn
in the road, until you become weary and exhausted.&nbsp; Man
cannot always be laughing.&nbsp; A perpetual joker must sometimes
excite a yawn.&nbsp; But we never found Dr. Shepherd guilty on
this head, and in this fashion.&nbsp; He was witty in season, but
not out of season.&nbsp; He could be the man of business.&nbsp;
He could bring gravity to the discussion of grave affairs, and
treat things serious with seriousness.&nbsp; But when in the
social circle, and amongst his friends, it was the season for
relaxing, then came forth the mighty stream of his wit, rolling
like another Mississippi, in its glorious, resistless course, and
sweeping all before it, and as remarkable for its point, polish
and elegance, as for its strength and poignancy.&nbsp; There were
few who could keep the saddle in the intellectual tournament with
him.&nbsp; Before that terrible lance, adversary after adversary
went down, like chaff before the wind.&nbsp; Nor do we recollect
any greater treat than a perusal of the correspondence with which
the Doctor used, from time to time, to season our newspaper
reading.&nbsp; Upon whatever controversy he entered, he was sure
to come off victorious.&nbsp; The very opposite to Mrs. Chick,
whose maxim was to carry <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>everything by &ldquo;an
effort,&rdquo; he never seemed to make any effort at all.&nbsp;
It was the very ease with which he crushed the most daring of his
foes which was so annoying to them, and so amusing to the
spectators.&nbsp; How he would bowl down a whole string of
sophistries, which had been boldly set up before the world as so
many philosophical conclusions not to be overturned!&nbsp; How he
would turn a fallacy inside out!&nbsp; How he would scatter every
kind of mystification, and expose every attempt at falsehood and
imposition!&nbsp; How he would strip every jackdaw of his
borrowed plumes, and raise the laugh against every presuming
quack!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; He was wit, scholar, philosopher, author,
controversialist, all in one, and good in all.&nbsp; But he was
something more.&nbsp; We believe Dr. Shepherd&rsquo;s charity,
for his means, to have been something wonderful.&nbsp; We have
heard of acts of kindness on his part which would have been
pronounced noble had they been performed by the wealthiest of our
merchant princes, or the highest in the land.&nbsp; What, then,
were they, when done by one of his limited income and
resources?&nbsp; His heart was a bank, upon which misery had only
to draw, and its drafts were sure to be accepted and
honoured.&nbsp; All respect to his name and memory!&nbsp; We know
few men who have lived more esteemed; we know of none who have
done more good in their time.&nbsp; Let his surviving friends
join with us in offering this tribute to one of the giants of the
past.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='S' title='S' src='images/dc12.jpg' />ome
people have very strange notions of the duties of the historian
and the biographer.&nbsp; They fancy that our part is to suppress
or distort the truth, and to substitute flattery for it; that we
should deal in sickening and nauseous eulogy only,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In sugar and spice,<br />
And all that&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and exert our energies in the vain effort to extract sunbeams
from cucumbers, or to make deal boards out of sawdust.&nbsp; The
child, walking in the churchyard, and reading the epitaphs,
exclaimed, &ldquo;Mother, where do they bury the bad people, for
I can only find the good ones here?&rdquo;&nbsp; But we are not
epitaph-mongers, we are not flattery-spinners, we are not
eulogy-penners.&nbsp; We are not, we never were, a society of
angels, and we take men as we find them.&nbsp; We are not making
a collection of fancy sketches, to be all beauties.&nbsp; We are
forming a cabinet of likenesses.&nbsp; We took up our pen with
this end in view, and we shall continue to work it out.&nbsp; We
shall tell &ldquo;the <a name="page69"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 69</span>truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shall &ldquo;nothing extenuate,
and nought set down in malice,&rdquo; but state facts as facts,
call a spade a spade, and describe men as they were, not as they
ought to have been.&nbsp; We have, of course, an object in these
prefatory remarks.&nbsp; We have.&nbsp; It seems that certain, it
may be well-intentioned, or it may be over squeamish, censors and
critics are bombarding us with good advice, to the effect that we
ought in chronicling the past to praise everybody; in other
words, as we have already hinted, to write epitaphs, not
history.&nbsp; But, once for all, we beg leave to state that we
are not going to take this advice.&nbsp; We have, however, two
propositions to make in answer to it.&nbsp; The first is, that
those amiable persons who are shocked by our plain speaking,
should just skip our effusions; or, if that does not satisfy
them, we will surrender our task and pen and inkstand altogether
to them, and allow them to begin with the next chapter, and carry
our work to a conclusion in their own fashion, which we doubt not
will be infinitely superior to our way of putting our rough notes
together, and stating our homely thoughts in homely
language.&nbsp; We trust that this offer will be accepted.&nbsp;
We would rather be learners than teachers, and shall be delighted
to be convinced that every common councilman of the last
generation was a Chesterfield and an Adonis, and every merchant a
Lindley Murray and an Admirable Crichton, miracles of wit,
literature and learning.&nbsp; But we, at all events, are not the
Plutarch to record the mythology, not the history, of these
impossible <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>prodigies and inconceivable wonders.&nbsp; And now we
proceed, until our critics volunteer to supersede us.&nbsp; But,
verily, as we return to our work, <i>vires acquirit eundo</i>, it
grows upon our hands.&nbsp; When first we undertook it, we had a
notion that we could in a brace of chapters dot down all our
reminiscences of the times we speak of.&nbsp; But here we are
now, in Chapter XII, with as yet no port in view, and scudding
along with all sail set over the interminable ocean of garrulity,
and with our catalogue of worthies growing into a far greater
magnitude than that of Homer&rsquo;s ships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is Mr. Birch,
afterwards Sir Joseph, the father of our late worthy
representative.&nbsp; A noble-looking specimen of the merchant
prince and the &ldquo;fine old English gentleman&rdquo; was Mr.
B., and much esteemed and respected by all who knew him.&nbsp;
And look at the tall, commanding figure that now
approaches.&nbsp; It is Mr. Brooks, the father of the venerable
Rector and Archdeacon of that name.&nbsp; And there were the
Walkers, who lived in Hanover-street, and who in their day were
the very tip-top of the tip-tops, and the head of all the gaiety
and fashion of Liverpool.&nbsp; And there were the Gregsons, ever
one of our first and leading families; and the Heskeths, and the
Midgleys, and the Caldwells.&nbsp; And Arthur Heywood, then a
middle-aged man, has a foremost place in our recollections.&nbsp;
And there were the Rathbones, Bensons and Croppers, of that
generation, as brave-hearted and active and zealous
philanthropists as their descendants of the present day.&nbsp;
And there was Hugh Mulleneux, who went through a long life <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>marked by
deeds of charity, and who to the last of his life, was one of the
most guileless and sterling men we ever met with.&nbsp; And there
were the other families of the same name, with a different
spelling, Thomas Molineux, William Molineux, and other brothers,
of whom we can safely say that we never heard any evil, and knew
much good.&nbsp; They had hearts exactly in the right place, and
with the right feelings in them.&nbsp; They are worthily
represented yet amongst us.&nbsp; Nor must we forget to chronicle
the name of old Mr. Yates, whose sons still walk worthily in the
steps of their respected sire.&nbsp; And there were Hughes and
Duncan, and the celebrated world-famous &ldquo;Tom
Lowndes,&rdquo; who shot like a meteor across the sky of the
commercial world, and who, in the magnificence of his
speculations, would have thought no more of bidding for the
United States for a cabbage garden, or of undertaking to pay off
the national debt at a week&rsquo;s notice, than he would of
swallowing his breakfast.&nbsp; A fine fellow comes next, Mr.
Nicholson, or Colonel Nicholson, as we used to call him, a title
which, we believe, he bore in the Militia.&nbsp; He was a
gentleman, out and out, through and through, every inch of him,
in look, in bearing, in manner, in feeling.&nbsp; We never saw,
to our fancy, a handsomer man than he was in those days, and
amiability sat on every feature of his noble countenance.&nbsp;
And how he could skate!&nbsp; How we have by turns laughed, and
trembled, and shouted, and clapped our young hands as we have
watched him darting along on the St. Domingo pit, and then
cutting figures of eight and all sorts of fancy <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>forms and
hieroglyphics on the ice, and taking the most surprising leaps,
and achieving all kinds of dangerous miracles.&nbsp; But, <i>arma
cedunt tog&aelig;</i>.&nbsp; The soldier subsequently subsided
into the citizen.&nbsp; Mr. Nicholson became a member of the
Corporation, and was Mayor of Liverpool.&nbsp; He married one of
the Miss Roes, in Queen-square.&nbsp; She was a niece of the
celebrated Council king, Mr. Shaw; and their son, having dropped
his paternal name for that of his maternal great-uncle, now lives
at Arrow, in Cheshire.&nbsp; He has a strong look of his father
in his features, and seems to have inherited his kindness of
heart and manner.&nbsp; And there go the Harveys, fine fellows
every one of them.&nbsp; And there is noble old Rushton, who,
like his son after him, our late respected and lamented
magistrate, had a head upon his shoulders with something in it,
and a heart swelling and flowing, aye, and overflowing, not
merely with a river, but with an ocean, of &ldquo;the milk of
human kindness.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shall we ever &ldquo;look upon his
like again?&rdquo;&nbsp; Selfishness was not in his nature.&nbsp;
He felt for the woes and sorrows of his fellow-creatures, without
respect to colour, climate, creed, or country.&nbsp; His
sympathies were universal.&nbsp; The earth&rsquo;s limits alone
were their limits.&nbsp; He might have taken for his motto the
glorious sentiment which, nearly two thousand years ago, called
forth such thunders of applause in the theatre of ancient
Rome:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Homo sum</i>, <i>humani nil a me alienum
puto</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All honour and respect and peace to his memory!&nbsp; But we
must go on, although you may say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>&ldquo;What! will the line stretch out to the crack of
doom?<br />
Another yet?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes; and one very different from our last-mentioned
hero.&nbsp; The next figure upon our canvas was also a character
in his way.&nbsp; Look at his bluff, resolute, determined
countenance.&nbsp; It is Captain Crowe, as brave a sailor and as
odd and eccentric a man as ever walked a quarter-deck.&nbsp;
Once, in the good ship <i>Mary</i>, he fell in with two English
sloops of war, somewhere in the middle passage, which Liverpool
ships were engaged upon in those times.&nbsp; They took his
trim-looking vessel for a French cruiser, and he took them for a
couple of the same craft.&nbsp; It was, however, nothing to old
Crowe that they were two to one.&nbsp; He was like the
stout-hearted ancient, who said that he would count his enemies
when he had beaten them.&nbsp; Night was coming on, and they
could not distinguish each other&rsquo;s flags.&nbsp; To it they
went, and kept at it hammer and tongs until morning showed them
the English colours floating on all their masts.&nbsp; The
cruisers had, in the dark, made several efforts to board him, and
had been repulsed with terrible loss.&nbsp; The firing of course
ceased as soon as the light showed them their mistake, and the
senior commander of the man-of-war sent an officer on board, with
a sulky civil message, to know if they could do anything for him
in the way of helping him to repair damages.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want
nothing,&rdquo; said the old Turk, with a grim smile, which meant
that he had given as much as he had taken in the action; &ldquo;I
want nothing, but a certificate to my owner that I have done my
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>And who
next?&nbsp; That is Taylor the brewer.&nbsp; And there is another
of the same trade, jolly old Ackers, great in malt and hops,
greater in politics, and greatest of all in the actual bustle and
conflict of an election.&nbsp; And there is his friend with him,
old Hesketh, the famous tailor, of Paradise-street.&nbsp; Instead
of being the ninth part of a man, Hesketh was nine men all in
one, the picture of a true Englishman, the very portrait of John
Bull himself, a regular old Tory, for men, out of his trade, more
than measures, and with such a good-tempered countenance, that it
drew customers, better than a thousand advertisements, to his
shop.</p>
<p>And there was another character who must not be excluded from
the &ldquo;curiosity shop&rdquo; of our reminiscences.&nbsp;
Every old stager must recollect Peter Tyrer, the coach-builder,
and keeper of hackney coaches.&nbsp; A very primitive-looking man
was old Peter, but as full of eccentricity and solemn jocularity
as an egg is full of meat.&nbsp; Peter&rsquo;s jests were always
uttered with a serious tone, and spoken out of his nose more than
through his lips, so that we laughed at the twang when there was
nothing else to laugh at.&nbsp; There was occasionally some
originality in his humour; but he had one standing joke, a very
grave one, which has now passed into a regular Joe Miller with
the men of his craft.&nbsp; Whenever any one came to order the
funeral cavalcade which he had to let out, he invariably pointed
to the plumed hearse, of which he was very proud, and observed,
&ldquo;That is the very thing for you, for of all that have
travelled by it none <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>have ever been heard to complain that
they had not an easy and pleasant journey by it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Poor Peter!&nbsp; And when thy turn came, we trust that thy
journey, both to the grave and through it, was an easy one!&nbsp;
Nor do we doubt it.&nbsp; With all his whims and oddities, Peter
was a good man, no idle professor, but a zealous, practical
Christian.&nbsp; We could do with more like him.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dc13.jpg' />mong
the great West Indian merchants of the days we are writing of, we
must not forget to place the James and France families.&nbsp; The
representative of the latter resides at Bostock Hall, not far
from Northwich, in Cheshire.&nbsp; The present Mr. James sat for
some years in the House of Commons, and gave evidence of talent
far beyond mediocrity.&nbsp; There was also a spice of
originality about him which commanded attention whenever he
spoke.&nbsp; It was but seldom, however, that he opened his
lips.&nbsp; Senatorial honours, we presume, had no attractions
for him.&nbsp; We so conclude from his voluntary and premature
retreat from their pursuit, much to the regret of all his
friends.&nbsp; There was another Mr. James in Liverpool in those
days, rather a rough-spun and unhewn kind of person, and very
eccentric and amusing in his way, a character, in short, amongst
his own circle.&nbsp; Many of our old readers must remember
Gabriel James, or, &ldquo;the Angel Gabriel,&rdquo; as some of
his waggish friends called him. He had a ready tongue and plenty
of mother wit, and seldom came off second best in a tilt and
tournament with words.&nbsp; Nor must we omit to mention old <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Mr.
Waterhouse, of Everton, a grave and venerable-looking man, whom
we always regarded with awe and reverence.&nbsp; There was Mr.
Neilson, too, whose sons still uphold the family name amongst us
with so much credit and respectability.&nbsp; And there was the
lively, gay, agreeable &ldquo;Jack Backhouse,&rdquo; who lived in
Smithdown-lane; and Mr. Backhouse of Everton, and another family
of the same name at Wavertree; and the Colquitts, and the Dawsons
of Mossley-hill.&nbsp; And the gay parties in those times used
frequently to be enlivened by Lord Henry Murray, who was often a
visitor with the Neilsons and Backhouses.</p>
<p>And we had also our circle of wits, whose sharp sayings were
passed round, as household words, from mouth to mouth, and so
afforded pleasure and amusement, as they spread from set to set,
from one extremity of society to the other.&nbsp; First and
foremost in this bright and brilliant band, we must place Mr.
Silvester Richmond, or &ldquo;Sil Richmond,&rdquo; as he was
generally called.&nbsp; Next to him was Joe Daltera.&nbsp; And
with them we must join Sam Pole, and &ldquo;Jim Gregson,&rdquo;
who lived in Rodney-street, a man of racy humour, with a fund of
originality about him which revelled in the utterance of good
things.&nbsp; And here be it observed, that, as Liverpool is
still called the town of &ldquo;Dicky Sams,&rdquo; so, in those
ancient days, its people were all Sils, and Joes, and Sams, and
Jims.&nbsp; It was the custom of the place, and equally
observable in every rank of society.&nbsp; But, for a time, let
us speak of our prince of wits, Sil Richmond, who was one of the
most sparkling, agreeable men ever met with in <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>company.&nbsp; Amongst his own set no party was ever
thought to be complete without him.&nbsp; He held the post of a
searcher in the Customs, and many were the amusing stories,
coined, perhaps, to raise a laugh at his expense, of the
&ldquo;diamond cut diamond&rdquo; warfare carried on between him
and persons striving to break the Revenue laws, of which he was a
most vigilant guardian.&nbsp; His powers of conversation were
immense, and never flagged.&nbsp; He was always the rocket, never
the stick; and he was as potent with the pen as he was brilliant
with the tongue.&nbsp; We may call him the poet laureate of the
Tories, with whom he warmly sided.&nbsp; The encounters,
therefore, between him and Dr. Shepherd, who was ever the
principal scribe for the liberal party, were frequent, fierce,
and savage.&nbsp; His weapons were not quite so keen and polished
as the doctor&rsquo;s, but they would do a great deal of mangling
work, and, like Ant&aelig;us springing from his mother earth, if
foiled and thrown in one round, he was always ready for
another.&nbsp; No amount of punishment could dishearten him, and
he was always in wind, and, what is more, kept his temper
unruffled in the thickest of the fray.&nbsp; He was the author of
all the election squibs in his day.&nbsp; Out they poured, grave
and gay, in prose and verse, and he seemed never to be
exhausted.&nbsp; We doubt not that some of our old stagers yet
retain many of them among their treasures and curiosities.&nbsp;
One line in one of his songs is still as fresh upon our mind as
if we had heard it but yesterday for the first time.&nbsp; Mr.
Fogg, a butcher, was one of the most zealous and active
canvassers in the <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>reform ranks at some election.&nbsp; Richmond instantly
had his eye upon him, and, bringing intellect as well as ink to
the work, thus impaled him on the point of his wit as he spoke of
him as</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A <span class="smcap">Fogg</span> that
could never be <span class="smcap">Mist</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, of course, told better in the midst of political
excitement; but still, at all times, we must admire it as a
specimen of our friend&rsquo;s ready wit.&nbsp; We used often to
look up at him in boyish wonder and admiration, as he cracked his
jokes, and his filberts, and his bottle all at the same
time.&nbsp; And one thing particularly struck us.&nbsp; He never
led the laugh at his own jests, but looked as grave as a judge,
and far more knowing, through his spectacles, while
&ldquo;setting the table in a roar.&rdquo;&nbsp; O, for another
Hamlet! to say for us, &ldquo;Alas, poor Yorick!&nbsp; I knew him
well, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent
fancy,&rdquo; etc.&nbsp; Of Mr. Richmond&rsquo;s family, one went
into the navy, and another into the army.&nbsp; They were both
fine young fellows.&nbsp; The soldier, called after his father,
distinguished himself and was wounded in the last, we hope that
it will always be the last, American war.</p>
<p>But we spoke of Mr., <i>alias</i> &ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; Daltera
just now, as one of the circle of wits in the former days which
are slipping from our memory.&nbsp; He was a regular character in
his day and in his way.&nbsp; He was brought up to be a
solicitor, and at one time was in partnership with the late Mr.
Topham.&nbsp; He had abilities to have raised himself to the
greatest eminence in his <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>profession, but he wanted business
habits.&nbsp; He had no application, no attention, no steadiness
of purpose.&nbsp; In short, he was of a jovial, convivial turn of
mind, full of fun and frolic and glee, was fond of company, and
greatly preferred shining in society to poring over
parchments.&nbsp; He was a terrible sitter at a party.&nbsp; He
never sung, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not go home till morning,&rdquo;
but practically it was impossible to get rid of him until long
after the short hours had set in; and, in truth, he was such a
pleasant companion, so overflowing with sparkling conversation,
&ldquo;full of mirth and full of glee,&rdquo; as we said before,
that no one ever made the attempt.&nbsp; Steady old fellows at
whose houses he used to visit would say, before he arrived,
&ldquo;We will be rude to that Daltera to-night, and give him a
hint that shall send him home in decent time.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
when the appointed hour had struck, and long after, these same
steady old boys, fascinated by Joe&rsquo;s wonderful powers of
jest and anecdote, were the loudest in pressing him to keep his
seat, a pressure which he never resisted.&nbsp; He thought, with
Dibdin&rsquo;s famous song, that there was &ldquo;nothing like
grog,&rdquo; or, as he and his familiars called it,
&ldquo;rosin.&rdquo;&nbsp; Often, when you thought that at last
he was really going, he would suddenly exclaim, instead of
&ldquo;one glass more,&rdquo; &ldquo;Now, lads, rosin again, and
then we&rsquo;ll positively go.&rdquo;&nbsp; He could not use his
pen like Richmond, but he was quite his match in wit and
repartee.&nbsp; Countless were the stories told of his sayings
and doings.&nbsp; Once the watchman found him in the street quite
unequal to steer his course home.&nbsp; This friend in need
wished to place him in a <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>wheelbarrow, and to carry him to his
house in this kind of triumphal car, when Daltera, steadying
himself for a moment, and throwing himself into a theatrical
attitude, astonished &ldquo;poor old Charley&rdquo; as he
addressed him, <i>a la</i> John Kemble, whom he had seen
performing the character that night, &ldquo;Villain, stand back;
the gods take care of Cato!&rdquo;&nbsp; We ourselves remember
crossing the river with him, in one of the old-fashioned
ferry-boats, before the invention of steamers.&nbsp; There was a
stiff breeze, next door to a gale of wind, blowing, and we were
in momentary peril from the rash attempt of the boatmen to head a
ship at anchor.&nbsp; The sailors themselves were alarmed, while
most of the passengers were in an agony of terror.&nbsp; One poor
market-woman, in the excess of her fright, threw herself upon her
knees in the middle of the boat, and burst out into the
exclamation, &ldquo;Lord have mercy upon us!&rdquo; when the
inveterate punster, alluding to the name of the river, thus cried
out to her, &ldquo;No, no, my good woman; do not say, &lsquo;The
Lord have <i>Mersey</i> upon us&rsquo; this time!&rdquo;&nbsp; We
were both vexed and shocked at the moment, as the jest out of
season jarred upon our ears, while the crew and the passengers
looked inclined to <i>extemporise</i> poor Joe into a Jonah at
the instant.&nbsp; But we have often smiled at it since.&nbsp;
Poor fellow, he could not help it.&nbsp; He could no more have
kept it in than the effervescence will remain quiet in a
ginger-beer bottle when the cork is drawn.&nbsp; It was the
ruling passion strong in death, or in the face of death.&nbsp;
Like Sheridan, &ldquo;he had it in him, and it would come
out.&rdquo;&nbsp; On another <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>occasion, it was said that, upon
landing from the boat at Runcorn, or some village between here
and Chester, he was seized upon by several persons, who supposed
him, from his dress of sober black, to be some celebrated
preacher whom they expected, and were on the look out for.&nbsp;
Joe, having made himself safe and certain on two points, namely,
in the first place, that none of the villagers had ever seen the
anticipated star; and, secondly, that he could not possibly
arrive that day by any conveyance, humoured the mistake, was
carried in triumph to the chapel, preached the most brilliant
sermon ever heard, and delighted and won the hearts of the
elders, by whom he was entertained, withal taking care to
disappear from the scene the next morning before the real Simon
Pure arrived.&nbsp; We do not, recollect, vouch for the accuracy
of all the details connected with this episode.&nbsp; We only
relate it as we have heard it related by Daltera himself a
hundred times.&nbsp; Poor Joe!&nbsp; He had many friends and only
one enemy, and that was himself.&nbsp; He wasted talents, energy,
wit, brilliancy, which would have made an intellectual capital
for a hundred shining characters.&nbsp; But who is
faultless?&nbsp; Let us look at the beam in our own eye.</p>
<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='I' title='I' src='images/dc14.jpg' />n our
last chapter we mentioned the names of some of the wits and
illustrious in jest of whom Liverpool could boast a few years
since.&nbsp; We now descend the scale, to speak of a class whom
we would mildly call &ldquo;the practical jokers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The <i>Spectator</i> makes glorious old Sir Roger de Coverley
horribly afraid of the club of Mohocks who, many years since,
pushed their horse-play in the metropolis into positive
ruffianism, and perpetrated the most savage outrages under the
name of fun and frolic.&nbsp; But the sports of the Liverpool
mischief-mongers at the commencement of the present century were
of a much more harmless and innocent character.&nbsp; One young
gentleman, who subsequently flourished as a grave old stager
amongst us, had a passion for collecting, in a kind of museum, or
&ldquo;curiosity shop,&rdquo; all the signs and signboards which
struck his fancy; and it was said that he had a large muster of
black boys, carried off from the different tobacconists&rsquo;
shops in the town.&nbsp; And sometimes he varied the amusement in
the following fashion:&mdash;In Pool-lane, now modernised into
South Castle-street, was a famous ship-instrument maker&rsquo;s
shop, in the front of which was elevated a wooden figure of a
midshipman <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>in full costume, at which we have often gazed with fond
delight in ancient days, and which we are now convinced must have
been the original of the one which Dickens, in Dombey, makes
Captain Cuttle contemplate with so much pride and pleasure.&nbsp;
Somewhere in the same locality was one of the tobacconists&rsquo;
shops of which we have spoken, with the then usual sign of a
black boy over the door.&nbsp; Time after time would our funny
and facetious friend substitute these signs one for the other, so
that, when morning broke, the midshipman would shine forth in all
his glory at the door of the snuff and tobacco store, while the
black boy would be grinning in front of the ship-instrument
maker&rsquo;s premises.&nbsp; At last the joke wore itself
out.&nbsp; The perpetrator of it never was discovered.&nbsp; He
preferred to play his &ldquo;fantastic tricks&rdquo; alone, and
kept his own secret.&nbsp; But there were also associated bodies
for the performance of the same kind of mad pranks.&nbsp; One set
of them formed themselves into what they dignified with the name
of &ldquo;A Committee of Taste,&rdquo; although they and their
friends called them, over their cups, &ldquo;The Minions of the
Moon.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their object seemed to be to emulate and
imitate the merry doings of Falstaff and his companions.&nbsp;
They occasionally, however, pushed their jokes somewhat too
far.&nbsp; There was a house in Daulby-street, then a sort of
<i>rus in urbe</i>, or, rather, country altogether.&nbsp; It had
a garden in front, and was ornamented with a verandah.&nbsp; This
it appears did not please these fastidious gentlemen, and the
owner was served with a notice, signed by &ldquo;the Chairman of
the Committee of Taste,&rdquo; directing him <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>to alter or
remove it by a certain day.&nbsp; To this command he paid no
attention.&nbsp; Well, the day arrived;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The ides of March are
come.&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Ay, C&aelig;sar; but not gone.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The verandah was still there.&nbsp; But that very night, at a
few minutes before twelve o&rsquo;clock, a loud knock at the door
called the owner of the house to the window which overlooked
it.&nbsp; The moment he appeared, with his head and the nightcap
upon it looming through the darkness, a cheer welcomed him from
the opposite side of the street.&nbsp; Then came a pull, and
smash, crash; the verandah, with all its trellis-work and
ornaments, was gone.&nbsp; The rogues had sawed away the
supports, made their ropes fast, and then, with wicked
waggishness, summoned the gentleman of the house to witness the
destruction of his offending property.&nbsp; We will chronicle
another of the feats of the &ldquo;Committee of
Taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; At that period Mr. Samuel Staniforth lived in
the large house at the bottom of Ranelagh-street, afterwards
converted into the famous Waterloo Hotel.&nbsp; Something about
it, either a shutter, or a knocker, or a bell-handle, we have
forgotten which, was excommunicated by this tasteful inquisition,
and ordered to be removed.&nbsp; Mr. Staniforth was about the
last man in the world to obey such a lawless mandate, being one
of that class who, &ldquo;if reasons were as plentiful as
blackberries, would not give one on compulsion.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
therefore treated the notice served on him with contempt.&nbsp;
And now the battle began in good earnest.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>&ldquo;When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of
war.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the thing denounced, whatever it was, was removed, then
restored, and again removed, to be once more restored, and still
in the original offending form, without an atom of
alteration.&nbsp; And so the struggle went on, until Mr.
Staniforth became highly exasperated, as well as extremely
indignant at the persevering annoyance.&nbsp; Of this, the
jokers, who met him with grave and sympathising faces every day
in society, were fully aware, and only made thereby more resolute
in their fun.&nbsp; In the extremity of his vexation he consulted
George Rowe, the attorney, of whom we have made honourable
mention in a former chapter.&nbsp; We speak from authority, for
we had the story from Mr. Rowe himself, who used often to tell it
with great glee.&nbsp; When the offended alderman had unbosomed
all his griefs to the solicitor, and had urged him to exert all
his vigilance to discover the offenders, and then to put in force
all the terrors and pains and penalties of the law against them,
the latter met the history of his sorrows with one of his
good-natured and hearty laughs, to the great astonishment of his
client, who certainly did not belong to the laughing portion of
the creation.&nbsp; When he had settled himself into seriousness,
he said, &ldquo;Well, Mr. Staniforth, I suppose, after all, your
object is to abate the nuisance, rather than trounce the
sinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; Staniforth, however, was not so sure that
he would not like to do both, and &ldquo;kill two birds with one
stone.&rdquo;&nbsp; But at last, after a long and serious
confabulation, he was persuaded to <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>leave the whole affair in the hands
of the lawyer, who, indeed, would only undertake it on that
condition.&nbsp; Now Mr. Rowe, although he had no guilty
knowledge of the offenders, had a shrewd guess in his own mind,
and, acting upon the impulse, wrote a note, desiring to have a
conference with the chief captain of the knocker and bell
banditti.&nbsp; They met, and on the next day glorious old
George, sending for Mr. Staniforth, laid the result before
him.&nbsp; The latter was exceedingly angry at first when he
heard that the bold rogues, instead of being overwhelmed with
sorrow and remorse, still took up very high ground, being
determined to make him capitulate on the immediate point at
issue, but with a promise on their part that he should never more
be annoyed by them on any other.&nbsp; At first he would listen
to no such terms, regarding any treaty with the parties as little
better than compounding for a felony.&nbsp; Gradually, however,
he yielded to the reasonings of his adviser, and the agreement,
without being duly signed and sealed, was honourably carried out
on both sides.&nbsp; &ldquo;And to whom,&rdquo; we said to George
Rowe, when sitting one day with him after dinner, with our legs
under his mahogany, &ldquo;to whom did you address your note when
you wanted to have this celebrated interview with the Chairman of
the Committee of Taste?&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, to Joe
Daltera, to be sure,&rdquo; he answered, with a very thunder-clap
of laughter, which almost made me tremble lest a blood vessel
should burst or apoplexy ensue; &ldquo;Why, to Joe Daltera, to be
sure, who else could it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But alas, alas! for the flight and power of time!&nbsp; <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Of the actors
in this amusing scene, all have passed from the arena of busy
life.&nbsp; We marvel whether any of the aforesaid
&ldquo;Committee of Taste&rdquo; yet survive, to sigh or to smile
over the wild pranks of their youth!&nbsp; But how is it that
such follies are only remembered, not perpetrated, now?&nbsp; As
Mr. Pickwick observed, when prosecuted for a breach of promise,
men are very much the victims and tools of circumstances.&nbsp;
When we look at the class to which the parties of whom we have
been speaking belonged, we can find many reasons, without any
boast of merit and improvement, which will explain why young
gentlemen in these times should not roam through the streets by
night, bent upon fun and mischief, for hours and hours.&nbsp;
Forty or fifty years ago, men met together to dine about three
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; They had, consequently, not only a longer
time to devote to the bottle, but also, when they broke up,
excited by wine, some hours to get through as best they could,
before they retired to bed.&nbsp; This would have a wonderful
influence upon their conduct.&nbsp; Moreover we had only a few
old watchmen in those days, who were as much alarmed at the
approach of our &ldquo;bucks,&rdquo; as the travellers by an
Eastern caravan at the appearance of the wild Arabs of the
desert.&nbsp; Again, the introduction of gas for lighting the
streets, instead of the old oil lamps which, &ldquo;few and far
between,&rdquo; used to twinkle in the distance and just to
&ldquo;make darkness visible,&rdquo; had a wonderful influence
upon the habits of our young men.&nbsp; Some great authority on
such matters in the metropolis calculated that, for enforcing
order, one <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>gas-lamp was equal, at least, to three policemen.&nbsp;
There are many persons over whom the fear of being found out
exerts a strong power.&nbsp; What they would do under the veil of
darkness they strenuously avoid when its shelter is
removed.&nbsp; The temptation may be strong, the will may be
present, but the opportunity is wanting.&nbsp; These remarks,
however, only apply to one class of society.&nbsp; But, when we
make our survey more general, we must also take into account the
march of knowledge, the increase of mechanics&rsquo; and literary
institutes, and the spread of cheap and useful books among the
masses.&nbsp; To the printing-press we doubtless owe much for our
improved tastes and habits.&nbsp; Who, indeed, can calculate the
might, the magnitude, and extent of its diversified influences
and powers?&nbsp; It is our schoolmaster, our instructor, our
guide, our guardian, our police, all in one.&nbsp; Praise and
honour to those who wield the pen, so long as they use it for the
benefit and advantage of their fellow-creatures.&nbsp;
Ill-disposed persons may pervert it to be an instrument of
evil.&nbsp; But who can tell the amount of its well-doing when
directed to good?&nbsp; Truly did the wit observe, that the
greatest stand ever yet made for the improvement and civilisation
of mankind was the inkstand.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dc15.jpg' /> little
back from Water-street, between it and St. Nicholas&rsquo;s
Church, stood an ancient Tower in those days.&nbsp; It was one of
the remaining antiquities of Liverpool.&nbsp; It had originally
belonged to the Lathoms of Lathom, and subsequently passed, by
the marriage of the heiress of that family, into the hands of the
Stanleys, some generations before the elevation of that
illustrious house to the Derby title.&nbsp; At a later period it
had become an assembly-room, and, last of all, by one of those
strange vicissitudes to which all earthly things are liable, was
a prison for debtors.&nbsp; But at the time we speak of there it
was, as if frowning in gloomy strength upon the encroachments
which modern improvements and the spirit of enterprise were
making on every side of it, a grim old giant, the type, and
symbol, and representative of other times.&nbsp; As we
contemplated its massive walls or walked under its shadow, what
reflections it was calculated to awaken within us.&nbsp; We were
then too young for our mind to dwell very seriously or very long
upon such topics, but we have often since thought within
ourselves that, if stone walls had ears, and eyes, and tongues,
what <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>strange histories that old Tower could have told.&nbsp;
It carried us back to what we call an age of romance, but what,
in fact, was an age of stern and iron realities.&nbsp; What
associations and recollections did the very sight of it conjure
up within us!&nbsp; The monument of many centuries of glory and
crime!&nbsp; In its day, although now merely an object of
curiosity and a prison for debtors, the palace and fortress of
nobles!&nbsp; In its day, perhaps, like other old castles within
the land, the living grave, and the grave, when dead, of the
guilty and innocent alike, of the ambitious and the victims of
ambition, of heroes and saints, of martyrs and traitors, of
princes and impostors, of patriots and conspirators!&nbsp; How
often has the mailed chivalry of the middle ages rode forth
through these gates in all its magnificence, pomp, and
pride!&nbsp; How often has chained innocence been dragged through
them to its dungeon&rsquo;s depths, and to the shambles to which,
perchance, they were the passage, feeling, as they turned upon
their grating hinges and shut it from the world for ever, all the
tremendous force of the &ldquo;Hope no more!&rdquo; which the
Italian poet wrote over the entrance to his Infernal
Regions!&nbsp; If, we repeat, its walls had tongues, what wonders
could they tell, what secrets reveal, what mysteries
unravel!&nbsp; What mighty or memorable names have resided, or
been imprisoned and perished here!&nbsp; What strange things have
been enacted within these gray old stones now crumbling into
ruin, while the wronged and the wrongdoers have together passed
to judgment!&nbsp; But the period for indulging such
contemplations has long since passed away.&nbsp; The spirit <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>of feudalism,
after holding its ground for so many centuries, at last yielded
to the genius of commerce, and the gloomy old Tower was
sacrificed upon the altars of modern improvement.&nbsp; Carters
and porters now shout and swear where stout old knights and
ladies fair held high revelry; and sugar hogsheads, and rum
puncheons, and cotton bales are now hoisted, and roll, and creak,
and clash where prisoners once groaned and chains clanked.&nbsp;
It is a new version of <i>arma cedunt tog&aelig;</i>.</p>
<p>But we are becoming grave; we moralise; we preach; <i>Vive la
bagatelle</i>.&nbsp; Let us go back for a few moments to the
subject of the last chapter, and speak a little more of those
mischief-mongers who dignified themselves with the title of
&ldquo;The Committee of Taste.&rdquo;&nbsp; We therein stated
that Daltera was the understood or suspected head of the said
Committee.&nbsp; On the same authority, neither better nor worse
than the assertion of common report, it was whispered that,
amongst its members, were some other dashing spirits of the day,
to wit, Mr. William, <i>alias</i> &ldquo;Billy Graham,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Young Sutton,&rdquo; as Mr. William of that ilk was always
called, &ldquo;Bob Pickering,&rdquo; <i>cum multis aliis</i>, the
<i>multis aliis</i> including some, we find, who are yet amongst
us, and whom, therefore, we would not name for all the world, and
so expose them to their children and grandchildren, who look up
to them as models of gravity, propriety, and piety.&nbsp; One
venerable gentleman, whom, from his confessions, we suspect to
have been at least an honorary member, said to us only the other
day,&mdash;and in such a free and easy and <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>impenitent
sort of way, that we verily believe that, with youth restored,
and opportunity returned, and policemen and gas-lamps
extinguished, he would soon be at his old pranks
again,&mdash;&ldquo;Daltera was always pre-eminent for good
taste, and was, therefore, elected President of the
Committee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Finding that our friend was inclined to
be communicative, we pressed him for more of his reminiscences,
when he added, &ldquo;They were fine fellows, and woe unto
anything that came under their waggish displeasure!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They carried on, he told us, a long war, a repetition of that
which has been already described between them and Mr. Staniforth,
with Mr. Parke, the celebrated surgeon, touching the shape of his
knocker.&nbsp; Dr. Solomon, who then lived in the large house at
the top of Low-hill, had his grounds studded over with statues,
of which he was not a little proud.&nbsp; They were voted to be
not classical by the men of taste, and the decree went forth for
their removal, and was carried out on the appointed night, when
they were all taken from their pedestals, the &ldquo;old
charley&rdquo; of the beat being either asleep, or feed or
frightened into silence.&nbsp; And we must record another of
their performances.</p>
<p>Our readers must recollect Mr. William Wallace Currie.&nbsp;
He was not himself a man of jokes, and he was about the last man
in the world to joke with.&nbsp; Well, he had an office for his
business, upon the door of which was inscribed, in the usual way,
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">William Wallace
Currie</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; One morning, upon his arrival, he was
utterly horrified to find into what the men of taste had
transmuted or translated him.&nbsp; The <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>introduction
of a comma and the addition of a single letter astonished him
with this new reading of his name and profession, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">William Wallace</span>, <span
class="smcap">Currier</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He joined in the
laugh, and there was an end of it.&nbsp; Nor is this the only
play upon Mr. Currie&rsquo;s name which we have to record.&nbsp;
The late Egerton Smith, to whom be all honour and respect as the
father of the Liberal press in this district, and for the honesty
and independence and goodness of character which distinguished
his long career, once made an admirable hit upon it, which,
although it has been in print before, will bear repeating, and is
worth preserving.&nbsp; When Mr. John Bourne, as worthy a man as
ever lived, was Mayor under the old Corporation, Mr. Currie was
one of his bailiffs; and Egerton, being asked on some occasion
for a toast or sentiment, following the Lancashire pronunciation
of their names, electrified the company by proposing,
&ldquo;<i>Burn</i> the Mayor, and <i>Curry</i> the
bailiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now for one more witticism from Daltera, of whom we have
already related so much.&nbsp; It was at the expense of the same
Mr. Fogg, whose impalement by Richmond, in an electioneering
song, we have immortalised in a former chapter.&nbsp; At a dinner
given at Ormskirk by the mess of a regiment of volunteers, or
local militia, in which Fogg was a subaltern, Daltera was among
the guests.&nbsp; When the cloth was removed, Poor Joe, as was
&ldquo;his custom of an afternoon,&rdquo; became very lively and
exhilarated, and, fancying that the other was somewhat dull,
suddenly turned to him, and slapping him on the back, <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>exclaimed,
&ldquo;Come, <i>Fogg</i>, <i>clear up</i>!&rdquo; amidst roars of
laughter from the party.&nbsp; A veteran officer of the Guards,
who happened to be one of the company, still tells this story
with the greatest glee and pleasure, and looks back upon the day
in question as one of the merriest and most amusing he ever
spent.</p>
<p>But we mentioned the name of Mr. William Wallace Currie just
now.&nbsp; We must return to him.&nbsp; He was not a man to be
casually mentioned and then passed by.&nbsp; He was the eldest
son of the great Dr. Currie.&nbsp; His abilities were above
mediocrity, and his mind well-cultivated and stored with
literature.&nbsp; He may be described as a reading man, in an
almost non-reading community.&nbsp; As a speaker, he was ready,
but not eloquent.&nbsp; He had more affluence of argument than
command of oratory, but he never failed to express himself to the
satisfaction of his hearers.&nbsp; In his own circle of society
he was much esteemed.&nbsp; As a party leader, he was greatly
respected by the public, who regarded him as that <i>rara
avis</i>, an honest politician.&nbsp; His life confirms the
verdict, for, with undoubted influence at his command, he never
used it to subserve his own ambition or push his own private
interest.&nbsp; That he was never in Parliament may be ascribed
to his own modesty.&nbsp; We have heard of more than one borough
where the electors would gladly have chosen him to be their
representative.&nbsp; Mr. Currie is still remembered with strong
affection by his friends, and, when they likewise have passed
away, his name will yet survive for many a generation in the
title-page of one of the most delightful books <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>which we ever
remember to have read.&nbsp; We speak of the <i>Life of Dr.
Currie</i>, by his son.&nbsp; In reading it, we were charmed and
fascinated by the letters and sentiments of the father, and so
pleased with the setting in which these jewels were exhibited to
us, that our only regret was, that the biographer did not, in
executing his task so well, give us more of his own work, but
left us to rise from the intellectual treat which he had set
before us with an appetite rather whetted than satisfied by the
feast which we had been enjoying.</p>
<p>We have said that the reading men in old Liverpool were
few.&nbsp; Let us chronicle another of their names, Mr. Alexander
Freeland, who still survives amongst us.&nbsp; His inquisitive
mind has long since, we may say, made the tour of literature, and
the stores of it which he has accumulated are surprising, as he
unlocks the treasuries of his mind in the chosen circle before
whom &ldquo;he comes out.&rdquo;&nbsp; We must also place another
veteran, Mr. Henry Lawrence, in the ranks of both well-read and
literary men.&nbsp; He always had a good seat in the intellectual
tournament, and carried a good lance in the tilting of wit.&nbsp;
He was never wanting to contribute his part, when present, at
&ldquo;the feast of reason and the flow of soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
catalogue all his clever sayings would be an endless work.&nbsp;
His conversational powers were brilliant and infinite.&nbsp; His
wit was keen and of the purest order.&nbsp; We defy the young
stagers of to-day to produce his match out of their ranks.</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='I' title='I' src='images/dc16.jpg' />t would
be a strange picture of &ldquo;Liverpool a few years since&rdquo;
which did not exhibit Mr. (afterwards Sir) John Gladstone in the
foreground of the canvas.&nbsp; He had, in those early days,
already taken his position, and was evidently destined to play a
conspicuous part in this busy world.&nbsp; We never remember to
have met with a man who possessed so inexhaustible a fund of that
most useful of all useful qualities, good common sense. It was
never at fault, never baffled.&nbsp; His shrewdness as a man of
business was proverbial.&nbsp; His sagacity in all matters
connected with commerce was only not prophetic.&nbsp; He seemed
to take the whole map of the world into his mind at one glance,
and almost by intuition to discover, not only which were the best
markets for to-day, but where there would be the best opening
to-morrow.&nbsp; What was speculation with others was calculation
with him.&nbsp; The letters which from time to time, through a
long series of years, he sent forth, like so many signal-rockets,
to the trading world, under the signature of <i>Mercator</i>,
were looked upon as oracular by a large portion of the
public.&nbsp; And there is little doubt that his authority was
often sought and <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>acted upon, in commercial legislation, by the different
Administrations by which the country has been governed during the
last half-century.&nbsp; We recollect, many years ago, standing
under the gallery of the House of Commons with the late Mr.
Huskisson.&nbsp; A sugar question was under discussion, and Mr.
Goulburn was hammering and stammering through a string of figures
and details, which it was clear he did not comprehend himself,
and which he was in vain labouring to make the House
comprehend.&nbsp; Mr. Huskisson smiled, as he quietly observed,
&ldquo;Goulburn has got his facts, and figures, and statistics
from Mr. Gladstone, and they are all as correct and right as
possible, but he does not understand them, and will make a
regular hash of it!&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone was himself in
Parliament for some years, and was always listened to most
respectfully on mercantile affairs.&nbsp; If he did not make any
very distinguished figure, it was because he did not enter upon
public life until he had reached an age at which men&rsquo;s
habits are formed, and at which they rather covet a seat in the
House of Commons as a feather or crowning honour of their
fortunes, than as an admission into an arena in which they intend
to become gladiators in the strife, and to plunge into all the
toils, and intrigues, and bustle of statesmanship.&nbsp; Had our
clever townsman entered Parliament at an earlier period, and
devoted himself to it, we have no doubt that he would have been
found a match for the best of them, and might have risen to the
highest departments of the Government.&nbsp; His name is well
represented amongst us still.&nbsp; He left four sons behind <a

whom, the Right Honourable William Ewart Gladstone, is second to
no statesman of the day, either in promise or performance,
eloquence or abilities.&nbsp; Mr. Gladstone lived in
Rodney-street, in a house subsequently taken by Mr. Cardwell, the
father of our late clever and gifted representative.&nbsp; So
that, by a remarkable coincidence, Mr. W. E. Gladstone and Mr.
Cardwell, severally the best men of their standing, first at the
university, and now in the list of statesmen, are not only from
the same county of Lancaster, which produces so large a
proportion of the able men in every profession, but from the same
town, and the same street in the same town, and the same house in
the same street.&nbsp; Did ever house so carry double, and with
two such illustrious riders, before?&nbsp; Nor must we forget to
mention Mr. Robert Gladstone, an amiable, kind-hearted man, and
one of the most agreeable persons ever to be met with in society,
always anxious to please and be pleased.</p>
<p>And there was Dr. Crompton, a fearless, outspoken man, English
all over in his bearing.&nbsp; He was the father of the new
judge, whose appointment enabled proud Liverpool to say that, as
before in Judge Parke, she had furnished the cleverest occupant
of the bench, so now she may boast that the two best are both her
sons.&nbsp; And what a glorious old fellow, kind, clever,
benevolent, well-read, well-informed, and well-disposed was
Ottiwell Wood.&nbsp; Who can forget him?&nbsp; His Christian name
was a curious and rare one.&nbsp; He was once a witness on some
trial, when the judge, rather puzzled in making out his name,
called upon him to <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>spell it.&nbsp; Out came the answer in sonorous
thunder: &ldquo;O double T, I double U, E double L, double U,
double O, D.&rdquo;&nbsp; His lordship, if puzzled before, was
now, if we may perpetrate such an atrocious pun, fairly
&ldquo;<i>doubled up</i>,&rdquo; amidst the laughter of the
court.&nbsp; We lately, in our travels, met with a gentleman at a
party in a distant county.&nbsp; His name, as he entered the
room, was announced, &ldquo;The Rev. Ottiwell
&mdash;.&rdquo;&nbsp; When we had been introduced to him, we
ventured to ask him where he got it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;I was so called after an old Lancashire relation
of mine, as worthy a man as ever lived, Mr. Ottiwell Wood, of
Liverpool.&rdquo;&nbsp; We struck up an alliance, offensive and
defensive, and &ldquo;swore eternal friendship&rdquo; on the
spot.&nbsp; We recollect another gentleman, also called Wood, who
once, playing upon the names of some of our fashionables, at a
party where he was amongst the guests, thus exclaimed, as he
entered the room, &ldquo;There are, I see, <i>Hills, Lakes</i>,
and <i>Littledales</i>, it only wanted Wood to perfect the
scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Littledales here mentioned were then, as the
representatives of the family still are, among the most thriving
and prosperous of our leading people.&nbsp; They brought both
intelligence and industry to their work.&nbsp; They owed nothing
to chance, for they left nothing to chance.&nbsp; And we may
truly say of them, that, to whatever branch of commerce or the
professions they devoted themselves, they deserved and adorned
the success which they achieved.&nbsp; And here we cannot pass on
without relating an excellent <i>bon mot</i> from the lips of
Judge Littledale, the brother of Anthony, <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>Isaac and
George, of the last generation, all, in their different ways,
distinguished men amongst our old stagers.&nbsp; Some years
since, a gentleman, now one of the most prominent of the rising
barristers on the Northern Circuit, had, when almost a boy, to
appear before the judge in some legal matter.&nbsp; We do not
understand the jargon and technicalities of the law.&nbsp; The
opposing party, however, moved that, in a certain case,
&ldquo;the rule be enlarged.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this our young
friend demurred, alleging, according to the letter of his
instructions, that &ldquo;he had never, in the whole course of
his experience, heard of a rule being enlarged under such
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied the
judge, with the blandest of smiles, &ldquo;young gentleman, we
will enlarge the rule and your experience at the same
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never was anything better than this uttered in
a court of justice.&nbsp; We heard the story from the young
gentleman of such great experience himself.&nbsp; It made an
impression on him that will never be effaced; and, doubtless,
when a judge himself, he will repeat the anecdote for the benefit
of the horse-hair wigs of the next generation.</p>
<p>But, to keep to Liverpool, there must be many yet alive who
remember Mr. D&rsquo;Aguilar among the celebrities and
fashionables of the town.&nbsp; A tall, fine-looking, portly man
he was.&nbsp; Mrs. D&rsquo;Aguilar was a charming person in
society, the life of every party, and retained to the end of a
long life all the vivacity and cheerfulness, as well as the
appearance, of youth.&nbsp; She seemed never to grow older.&nbsp;
One of their sons, Mr. Joseph D&rsquo;Aguilar, was decidedly
among the wits of the day, <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>and had many a sharp saying and good
story attributed to him.&nbsp; Another was General
D&rsquo;Aguilar, who distinguished himself in the Peninsular war,
and is the soldier, scholar and gentleman, all three combined in
one.&nbsp; Mrs. Laurence, so long the queen of fashion in this
locality, was one of their daughters, and, like her brothers,
inherited a large portion of intellect from her parents.&nbsp;
The patroness of literature in others, she has herself just gone
far enough into its realms to excite our regret that she has not
gone further.&nbsp; A kindred spirit of Mrs. Hemans, we often
wish that she had not only extended her sympathies to that gifted
genius, but had, with her own pen, roamed with her, &ldquo;fancy
free,&rdquo; into the regions of poesy, and emulated her
inspirations.</p>
<p>And here let us turn aside to embalm the memory of another old
stager, well known and much liked in his day, William
Rigby.&nbsp; A gentleman in his bearing, endowed with no slight
powers of conversation; clever, witty, social, convivial, he was
a most popular man in his circle.&nbsp; And, besides, he played a
hand at whist second to none, which always made him a welcome
guest at houses where card tables appeared.&nbsp; He was a tall,
handsome man, with eyes twinkling with the humour and jocularity
which made him such an agreeable companion.&nbsp; And shall we
forget Devaynes, that nonpareil of an amateur in the conjuring
line?&nbsp; Talk not to us of your wizards of the north, or of
the south, or of the east, or of the west.&nbsp; Devaynes was
worth them all put together.&nbsp; How we have stared in our
boyish days, half in wonder and <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>half in alarm, at his wonderful
tricks, perfectly convinced in our own mind that such an
accomplished master of arts must assuredly be in league with some
unmentionable friend in the unseen world.&nbsp; As you sat at
table with him, your piece of bread would suddenly begin to walk
towards him.&nbsp; Before you had recovered from this
astonishment your wine glass would start after it, next your
knife and fork, and then your plate would move, like a hen after
its chickens, in the same direction.&nbsp; And then how he would
swallow dishes, joints of meat, decanters, and everything that
came in his way.&nbsp; He was a perfect terror to the
market-women, who really believed that he was on the most
intimate terms with the unmentionable old gentleman
aforesaid.&nbsp; Having made his purchases and got his change for
his guinea or half guinea, he would put the coin into their hand,
and say to them, &ldquo;Now, hold it fast, and be sure you have
it;&rdquo; and then, before leaving them, he would add,
&ldquo;Look again, and be certain,&rdquo; when, the hand being
opened, there was either nothing in it, or perhaps a farthing, or
a sixpence.&nbsp; And even when the joke was over, and he had
left the market, they eyed the fairy money both with suspicion
and alarm, lest it should disappear, and were never easy until
they had paid it away in change to some other customer.&nbsp; How
well we remember these things!&nbsp; The performer of them was a
quiet, unassuming man, much respected by all who knew him, and
certainly one of whom it could not be said that he was &ldquo;no
conjuror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='W' title='W' src='images/dc17.jpg' />e have
spoken in a former chapter of the oil lamps, which, &ldquo;few
and far between,&rdquo; just made darkness visible, and of the
old watchmen, who were supposed or not supposed to be the
guardians of our lives and property.&nbsp; The latter deserve
another word.&nbsp; The old watchmen, or &ldquo;Charleys,&rdquo;
as they were generally called, were perfect &ldquo;curiosities of
humanity,&rdquo; and the principle on which they were selected
and the rules by which they were guided were as curious as
themselves.&nbsp; They seem to be chosen as schoolmasters are
still chosen in remote villages in the rural districts, namely,
because they were fit for nothing else, and must be kept off the
parish as long as possible.&nbsp; They were for the most part,
wheezy, asthmatic old men, generally with a very bad cough, and
groaning under the weight of an immense great coat, with immense
capes, which almost crushed them to the ground, the very ditto,
indeed of him of whom it was written,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pity the sorrows of a poor old man,<br />
Whose trembling limbs have borne him to your door.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They carried a thick staff, not so much a weapon of offence as
to support their tottering steps.&nbsp; They had <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>also
rattles in their hands, typical, we presume, of the coming
rattles in the throat, for they were of no earthly use
whatever.&nbsp; Each of them was furnished with a snug box, in
which they slept as long as possible.&nbsp; But, if ever they did
wake up, their proceedings were of a most remarkable kind.&nbsp;
They set forth round their beat with a lantern in their hands, as
a kind of a beacon to warn thieves and rogues that it was time to
hide, until these guardians of the night had performed the farce
of vigilance and gone back to snore.&nbsp; Moreover, like an army
marching to surprise an enemy with all the regimental bands
performing a grand chorus, they also gave notice of their
approach to the same kind of gentry by yelling the hour of the
night and the state of the weather with a tremulous and querulous
voice, something between a grunt and a squeak, which even yet
reminds us of the lines in Dunciad;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Silence, ye wolves! while Ralph to Cynthia
howls,<br />
And makes night hideous: answer him, ye owls.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, to be sure, the wisdom of our forefathers had a double
object in view when they ordered this musical performance to be
got up.&nbsp; It not only saved the poor old watchmen from
conflicts in which they must have suffered grievously, but it
served another purpose, and so &ldquo;killed two birds with one
stone&rdquo; with a vengeance.&nbsp; Only fancy the happiness of
a peaceful citizen, fast asleep after the toils and fatigues of
the day, to have his first slumber disturbed that he might be
told that it was &ldquo;half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock, and a
cloudy <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>night,&rdquo; and then, by the time that he had
digested this interesting intelligence and was composing himself
on his pillow again, to be again aroused to learn that it was now
&ldquo;twelve o&rsquo;clock, and a starlight morning,&rdquo; and
so on every half-hour until day-break.&nbsp; The vagaries of the
veritable queen Mab, with &ldquo;tithe-pigs&rsquo; tails&rdquo;
and all the rest of it, were only more poetical, not the least
more rest-disturbing, than the shouts of these bawlers of the
night.&nbsp; Truly, the watch committee of those days might have
taken for their motto, &ldquo;Macbeth does murder
sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; And many were the funny tricks played upon
these poor, helpless old creatures, by the practical jokers who
then so abounded amongst us.&nbsp; Sometimes they would, when
caught napping, be nailed up in their boxes, while occasionally,
by way of variety, their persecutors would lay them gently on the
ground with the doors downwards, so that their unhappy inmates
would be as helpless as a turtle turned upon its back, and be
kept prisoners till morning.&nbsp; In short, &ldquo;a
Charley&rdquo; was considered fair game for every lover of
mischief to practise upon, and their tormentors were never tired
of inventing new devices for teazing and annoying them.&nbsp;
Latterly, however, as the town grew larger, the veteran
battalions, the cripples, wheezers, coughers, and asthmatics,
were superseded by a more stalwart race, who looked as if they
would stand no nonsense, and could do a little fighting at a
pinch.</p>
<p>The last of these men, whom we recollect before the
establishment of the new police, had the beat in the
neighbourhood of Clayton-square.&nbsp; Many of our <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>readers
must recollect him.&nbsp; He was a six-foot muscular
Irishman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, Pat,&rdquo; some of the young ones,
who are middle aged gentlemen now, used to say to him,
&ldquo;Well, Pat, what of O&rsquo;Connell?&rdquo;&nbsp; On such
occasions Pat invariably drew himself up, like a soldier on
parade, to his full height, looked devoutly upwards, and then
solemnly exclaimed, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s One above,
sir&mdash;and&mdash;next to him&mdash;is Daniel
O&rsquo;Connell!&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was a name to conjure with
in his day!&nbsp; We respected, as often as we heard of it, that
poor fellow&rsquo;s reverence for his mighty countryman, and felt
that, had we been Irish, we also should have placed that name
first and foremost in our calendar of saints, martyrs, patriots
and heroes.&nbsp; Who is there now of his name and nation who can
rise and say, &ldquo;Mr. Speaker, I address you as the
representative of Ireland.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, forward.&nbsp; How
the old times, and the old things, and the old oil-lamps, and the
old watchmen have all passed away and disappeared!&nbsp; And the
old pigtails, too, have vanished with them.&nbsp; When we first
escaped from petticoats into jacket and trousers, every man,
young and old, wore a hairy appendage at the back of his head,
called a pigtail, as if anxious to support Lord Monboddo&rsquo;s
theory, that man had originally been a tailed animal of the
monkey tribe; for surely our <i>wholesale re-tailing</i>, if we
may so speak, could have been for no other purpose.&nbsp;
Pigtails were of various sorts and sizes.&nbsp; The sailors wore
an immense club of hair reaching half-way down their backs, like
that worn by one of Ingoldsby&rsquo;s heroes, and thus described
by him,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;And his pigtail is long, and bushy, and
thick,<br />
Like a pump handle stuck on the end of a stick.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Those of the soldiers were somewhat less in magnitude, but
still enormous in their proportions.&nbsp; And quiet citizens
wore jauntily one little dainty lock, tied up neatly with black
ribbon, and just showing itself over the coat collar.&nbsp; It
was a strange practice, but custom renders us familiar with
everything.&nbsp; At last, however, Fashion, in one of her
capricious moods, issued her fiat, and <i>pigtails</i> were
<i>curtailed</i>.&nbsp; But some few old stagers, lovers of
things as they were, and the enemies of all innovation, saw
revolution in the doom of pigtails, and persevered in wearing
them long after they had generally disappeared.&nbsp; The pigtail
finally seen in society in Liverpool dangled on the back of
&mdash;; but, no, no! never mind his name.&nbsp; He still toddles
about on &rsquo;Change, and might not like to be joked about it,
even at this distance of time.&nbsp; Its fate was curious.&nbsp;
Through evil report and good report he had stood by that pigtail
as part and parcel of the British Constitution, the very
Palladium of Magna Charta, Habeas Corpus, and the Bill of
Rights.&nbsp; But the time for a new edition of <i>The Rape of
the Lock</i> arrived.&nbsp; He dined one day with a party of gay
fellows like himself.&nbsp; The bottle went freely round, until,
under its influence, our unlucky friend fell fast asleep.&nbsp;
The opportunity was seized upon.&nbsp; After some hours&rsquo;
refreshing slumber he awoke, and found himself alone.&nbsp; On
the table before him was a neat little parcel, directed to him,
made up in silvery paper, and <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>tied with a delicate blue
ribbon.&nbsp; What could it be?&nbsp; He eagerly opened it, and
found, <i>Il Diavolo</i>! that it was his pigtail.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Achilles&rsquo; wrath,&rdquo; as sung by Homer, was
nothing compared with the fury of the wretched man.&nbsp; He
stormed, he swore, he threatened, but he could never discover who
had been the operator who had so despoiled him, like another
Samson, of his pride.&nbsp; Let us hope that remorse has severely
visited the guilty criminal.&nbsp; Its work, however, must have
been inwardly, for outwardly he is a hale, hearty,
cheerful-looking old man, who still carries himself among his
brother merchants as if he had never perpetrated such an enormous
atrocity.</p>
<p>This, we said, was the last of the pigtails seen in Liverpool
society.&nbsp; But we did meet with another, the very <i>Ultimus
Romanorum</i>, after a lapse of many years, under very peculiar
and interesting circumstances.&nbsp; We were walking in
Lime-street, when all at once we caught sight of a tall,
patriarchal, respectably-dressed man, some three-quarters of a
century old, with a pigtail.&nbsp; It was like the ghost of the
past, or a mummy from Egypt, rising suddenly before us.&nbsp; The
old gentleman, whose pigtail seemed saucily to defy all modern
improvements as the works of Satan and his emissaries, was, with
spectacles on nose, reading some document on the wall.&nbsp;
Being naturally of an inquisitive turn of mind, and especially
anxious at that moment to find out what still on earth could
interest a pigtail, we stopped to make the discovery.&nbsp; Ha!
ha ha!&nbsp; It nearly killed us with laughter.&nbsp; It was the
electioneering address of Sir Howard Douglas.&nbsp; No <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>wonder the
old man&rsquo;s sympathies were excited: it was pigtail studying
pigtail, Noah holding sweet communion with Methuselah or Tubal
Cain.&nbsp; We often marvel within ourselves whether that last
survivor of the pigtail dynasty is yet alive, and whether he
believes in steam-ships, and railways, and electric telegraphs;
whether indeed he believes in the nineteenth century at all, or
in anything except Sir Howard Douglas and pigtails.</p>
<p>Hair-powder, which also used generally to be worn in those
days, went out of fashion with pigtails.&nbsp; It was in allusion
to this practice that the old song laughingly asked,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And what are bachelors made of?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Powder and puff,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And such like stuff,<br />
Such are bachelors made of&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Made of!<br />
Such are bachelors made of.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even ladies wore hair-powder.&nbsp; The last, within our
memory, so adorned, was Mrs. Bridge, the mother of Mr. James
Oakes Bridge, who lived in St. Anne-street, and a fine, stately,
venerable lady of the old school she was.</p>
<p>A terrible time was it for hair-dressers, who then carried on
a thriving business, when pigtails and hair-powder were abolished
at one fell swoop.&nbsp; It was in reality to them like the
repeal of the Navigation laws, in idea, to the ship-owners, or
free-trade to the farmers.&nbsp; We were amusingly reminded of it
only a few weeks since.&nbsp; Being on our travels, with rather a
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>wilderness of hair upon our head, we turned into a
barber&rsquo;s shop, in a small town through which a railway,
lately opened, runs.&nbsp; The barber had a melancholy look, and
seemed to be borne down by some secret sorrow, to which he gave
utterance from time to time in the most dreadful groans.&nbsp; At
length he found a voice, and rather sobbed than said, &ldquo;Oh
sir, these railways will be the ruin of the country!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Did our ears deceive us?&nbsp; Or was the barber really gone
mad?&nbsp; We were silent, but, we suppose, looked unutterable
things, for he continued, &ldquo;Yes, sir, before this line was
opened, I shaved twenty post-boys a day from the White Hart, and
now if I shave one in a week I am in high luck.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Unhappy shaver, to be thus shaved by the march of
improvement!&nbsp; And inconsistent George Hudson! thou talkest
of the vested rights of shipowners and landlords, and yet didst
thou ever stay thy ruthless hand and project a line the less that
country post-boys might flourish, and country barbers live by
shaving their superfluous beards?&nbsp; O! most close shaver
thyself, not to make compensation to thy shavers thus thrown out
of bread and beards by thy countless innovations!</p>
<p>But it is time that we should finish this chapter, and we will
do so with copying an anecdote touching hair powder, which
greatly struck us as we lately read it in the <i>History of
Hungary</i>.&nbsp; Some great measure was under discussion in the
diet of that country, when Count Szechenyi appeared in the
Chamber of Magnates, on the 28th of October, 1844, in splendid
uniform, his breast covered with stars and ribbons of the various
<a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>orders
to which he belonged.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is now thirty-three
years,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and eleven days since I was sent to
the camp of Marshal Blucher.&nbsp; I arrived at the dawn of day,
and at the entrance of the tent found a soldier occupied in
powdering his hair before a looking-glass.&nbsp; I was rather
surprised, but, on passing on a little further, I found a page
engaged in the same way.&nbsp; At last I reached the tent of the
old general himself, and found him, like the others, powdering
and dressing his hair also.&nbsp; &lsquo;General,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;I should have thought this was the time to put powder in
the cannon and not in the hair.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We
hope,&rsquo; was the reply, &lsquo;to celebrate a grand
<i>f&ecirc;te</i> to-day, and we must, therefore, appear in our
best costume.&rsquo;&nbsp; On that day the battle of Leipsic was
fought.&nbsp; For a similar reason, gentlemen, I appear here
to-day, dressed in this singular manner.&nbsp; I believe that we
are to-day about to perform one of the brightest acts in the
history of our nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The address was received with
loud acclamations.&nbsp; But hair-powder and gunpowder have, we
believe, long since been divorced, even in the camp.&nbsp; It was
inconvenient.&nbsp; It was found, as touching the former, that,
on a hot day, it was impossible &ldquo;to keep your powder
dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
<img class='dc' alt='W' title='W' src='images/dc18.jpg' />hether
we consider the magnificence of its estate, the amount of its
revenue, or the extent of its influence, the Liverpool
Corporation might ever be compared to a German principality put
into commission.&nbsp; We have, in a former chapter, alluded
briefly to its state and condition in those old days, when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;All went merry as a marriage
bell,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and no Municipal Reform Bill ever loomed in the
distance.&nbsp; But we feel that we must say something more about
such an important body.&nbsp; The old Liverpool self-elected
Corporation was always looked up to and spoken of with respect
from one end of the country to the other.&nbsp; It was, indeed,
considered to be a kind of model Corporation by all others, and
quoted, and emulated, and imitated on all occasions and in all
directions.</p>
<p>We have said that it was self-elected.&nbsp; We must add that
it was most exclusive in its character and formation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t shave gentlemen in your line,&rdquo; says
the hair-dresser in <i>Nicholas Nickleby</i> to the <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>coal-heaver.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; retorted the
other, &ldquo;I see you a-shaving of a baker, when I was
a-looking through the winder last week.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s necessary to draw the line somewheres, my fine
feller,&rdquo; replied the principal.&nbsp; &ldquo;We draw the
line there.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t go beyond bakers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so it was with the old Corporation.&nbsp; They drew a line in
the admission of select recruits into their body, and strictly
kept to it.&nbsp; All tradesmen and shopkeepers, and everything
retail, were carefully excluded, and classified in the
non-presentable &ldquo;coal-heavers&rsquo; schedule.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But they were not only exclusive in the fashion which has been
indicated, but in other ways also.&nbsp; Their line of
distinction was more than a separation of class from class.&nbsp;
They were not only a self-elected body, but a family party, and
carefully guarded the introduction of too many
&ldquo;outsiders,&rdquo; if we may so speak, of their own rank
and order in society.&nbsp; They would, indeed, occasionally
admit a stranger, without any ties of relationship to recommend
him.&nbsp; But this was only done at long intervals, and just to
save appearances.&nbsp; Thus, such men as Mr. Leyland, Mr. Lake,
and Mr. Thomas Case were, from time to time, introduced into the
old Corporation.&nbsp; But extreme care was taken that the new
blood should never be admitted in too large a current.&nbsp; For
the same reason, that of saving appearances, our ancient
municipals, although ultra-Tory in their politics, occasionally
opened the door of the Council Chamber to a very select
Whig.&nbsp; Nothing, however, was gained for the public by this
quasi-liberality of conduct.&nbsp; The Whigs, so introduced,
generally fell into the ways of the <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>company into which they had been
admitted; and it was remarked, that in every distribution of
patronage they were at least as hearty and zealous jobbers as the
most inveterate Tories.&nbsp; This may have been said
enviously.&nbsp; But, at all events, it was said.&nbsp; We are,
recollect, writing history, not censure.&nbsp; Human nature is of
one colour under every shade of politics.&nbsp;
&ldquo;C&aelig;sar and Pompey very much &lsquo;like, Massa;
&lsquo;specially Pompey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have said that, with the exception of the occasional Whig
admitted for the sake of appearances, or to be ornamental, the
politics of the old Corporators tended to extreme Toryism.&nbsp;
They were, nevertheless, divided into two parties, as cordially
hating each other as the rival factions in Jerusalem.&nbsp; As
their opinions on all great public matters exactly coincided, the
apple of discord between them must have been the immense
patronage at their disposal, and which was too often considered
as the heirloom of the Corporate families.&nbsp; On one side were
the Hollingsheads, Drinkwaters, Harpers, etc.&nbsp; On the other,
and at that time, and for years after, the stronger interest,
were arrayed the Cases, Aspinalls, Clarkes, Branckers, etc.&nbsp;
The latter party owed much of their preponderance to the
influence of the great John Foster of that day, who, although not
a member of the Council himself, possessed a strange power over
its decisions and judgments, and brought to his friends the aid
of as much common sense and as strong an intellect as ever were
possessed by any individual.&nbsp; But it is not to be supposed
that the members of the former Corporation <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>limited
their attention and zeal to the battle for patronage and
place.&nbsp; Let us do them justice.&nbsp; Considering the
immensity of the trust committed to their charge, the fact that
there was no direct responsibility to check, control, or guide
them, and the sleepy sort of animal which public opinion, now so
vigilant and wakeful, so open-eared, open-eyed, and loud-tongued,
was in those old stagnant times, our conviction has always been
that they performed their duty miraculously well.&nbsp; We are
neither their accusers nor eulogists.&nbsp; If they were not
perfect, they were not altogether faulty.&nbsp; They expended the
town&rsquo;s revenues for the town&rsquo;s good.&nbsp; Their
foresight extended to the future as well as the present.&nbsp;
They perceived the elements of coming greatness which the port of
Liverpool possessed, and laid the foundation, often in the face
of as loud clamour and criticism as those days were capable of
exciting, of their growth and development.&nbsp; Their successors
have but walked in the path which they had opened, and carried
out the plans which these Council forefathers had devised.&nbsp;
In every part of the town may be seen their works and creations,
carried on under the superintendence of the Mr. Foster whom we
have mentioned, and of his gifted son, too little appreciated
amongst us until he was beyond the reach of all human praise and
applause.&nbsp; On the tablet to Sir Christopher Wren, in St.
Paul&rsquo;s, London, it is written, <i>Si monumentum
qu&aelig;ris</i>, <i>circumspice</i>.&nbsp; And, even so, if we
are asked to point out the ever-abiding epitaph which, from
generation to generation till the world&rsquo;s last blaze, <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>will uphold
the memory of our old defunct Corporation, we should answer
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Liverpool</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; When we
are told of their extravagance; when we hear of their nepotism;
when their spirit of exclusion is scoffed at; when their ultra
politics are ridiculed; let us draw a veil over all and
everything, as we contemplate our docks, our churches, our public
buildings, and once more exclaim, <i>Si monumentum
qu&aelig;ris</i>, <i>circumspice</i>.&nbsp; These speaking
memorials will remain when all their faults are forgotten!</p>
<p>But we said, just now, that the members of the old Corporation
would, from time to time, for the sake of appearances, admit a
select Whig or Liberal into their number.&nbsp; This reminds us
of a good story, which was circulated at the time, when it was
debated among them whether they should or should not elect the
present Mr. William Earle.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a very clever
fellow,&rdquo; said one of them to a grim old banker, thinking
thereby to conciliate his favour and win his support.&nbsp; The
eulogy had just a contrary effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;So much the
worse,&rdquo; replied old money-bags, &ldquo;we have too many
clever fellows amongst us already.&rdquo;&nbsp; As nobody cried
out, &ldquo;Name, name!&rdquo; the list of this multitude, this
constellation of clever ones, is lost to posterity.&nbsp; And,
having mentioned this joke against one of the old Council, let us
add another.&nbsp; One day Prince William of Gloucester and his
staff of officers were dining with a certain member thereof, who
treated them with the best which his house contained and which
money could command.&nbsp; When the cloth was drawn, his wines,
which were excellent, were not <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>only enjoyed, but highly
praised.&nbsp; Being a little bit of a boaster, he perpetrated a
small white fib by saying, &ldquo;Yes! that port is certainly
very fine, but I have some better in the cellar.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let us try it,&rdquo; instantly rejoined a saucy young
<i>aide-de-camp</i>, amidst the laughter of the company at the
alderman being thus caught in his own trap.&nbsp; On another
occasion it was said that the presiding genius at a table where
His Royal Highness was a guest, thus encouraged his appetite,
&ldquo;Eat away, your Royal Highness, there&rsquo;s plenty more
in the kitchen.&rdquo;&nbsp; For the honour of Liverpool
refinement, be it known that it was not one of our natives who
made this speech, so much more hospitable than polite.&nbsp; It
was a gentleman of an aristocratic family, officially connected
with the town.&nbsp; But taste was not so fastidious, neither was
society so conventional, in those days as they are now.&nbsp; The
most expressive word was the word used when it was intended to
mean warm sincerity, not empty form.</p>
<p>And what a crowd of the county nobility and the gentry were
invited to the Corporation banquets in those old days.&nbsp;
There was the venerable Earl of Derby, the grandfather of the
present Lord.&nbsp; There was likewise the Earl of Sefton, gay,
dashing, and agreeable.&nbsp; Mr. Bootle Wilbraham, and Mr. Bold
of Bold Hall, then Mr. Patten, were frequent guests at the
Mayor&rsquo;s table.&nbsp; And there was old Mr. Blackburne, who
was the county member for so many years in those quiet times of
Toryism, when the squirearchy reigned supreme even in the
manufacturing districts.&nbsp; An easy-going man, of very
moderate abilities, was <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>old Squire Blackburne.&nbsp; He
stuck by his party, and his party stuck by him.&nbsp; Many a
sugar-plum of patronage fell into the mouths of his family and
friends.&nbsp; The Mr. Blundell of Ince, of that day, came
frequently amongst us, although, generally speaking, a man of
reserved habits, and more given to cultivate his literary tastes
than to mix in company.&nbsp; He presented one of the Mayors of
Liverpool, Mr. John Bridge Aspinall, with a portrait of himself,
half-length, and an admirable likeness.&nbsp; It hung for many
years in the drawing-room of the gentleman in Duke-street.&nbsp;
Side by side with it was a splendid painting of Prince William of
Gloucester, also a gift from His Royal Highness to Mr.
Aspinall.&nbsp; Where they are now we know not.&nbsp; But, when
dotting down the names of some of the neighbouring gentry who
used to look in upon us some forty odd years ago, we must not
forget to recall honest John Watkins, &ldquo;the Squire&rdquo; of
Ditton.&nbsp; Squire Watkins, as many of our old stagers will
recollect, was a Tory, if ever there was one in the world.&nbsp;
But a noble-souled, true-hearted, generous, hospitable man was he
withal, as ever lived, a kind of Sir Roger de Coverley, from the
crown of his head to the sole of his foot.&nbsp; And what a house
he kept!&nbsp; And how he came out in his especial glory on his
coursing days, when all the Nimrods and Ramrods in the county
assembled under his roof, and did not resemble a temperance
society in the slightest degree.&nbsp; Poor old Squire
Watkins!&nbsp; Some terrible Philistine once planted a hedge, or
built a wall, we forget which, which trespassed, or was supposed
to trespass, an <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>inch or two upon his land.&nbsp; It was just the sort
of trifle for two people in the country with nothing to do to
quarrel about.&nbsp; The feud, or &ldquo;fun, grew fast and
furious.&rdquo;&nbsp; The squire insisted upon the removal of the
encroachment.&nbsp; His opponent refused.&nbsp; Threats followed,
defiance succeeded, until, one morning, like Napoleon making his
swoop upon Brussels, John Watkins, Esq., took the field at the
head of his household troops, the butler, coachman, groom,
gardener, etc.&nbsp; At last they arrived on the field of
Waterloo.&nbsp; But the opposing Wellington was already there, in
position with his followers, himself in front with a
double-barrelled gun in his hand.&nbsp; Nothing daunted, the
squire, pointing to the encroaching fence which was to be
destroyed, cheered on his men to the attack, and the &ldquo;Old
Guard&rdquo; advanced merrily to the charge.&nbsp; But they were
presently brought to a check.&nbsp; &ldquo;Up Guards!&rdquo;
shouted the hostile Wellington as they approached, while
&ldquo;click&rdquo; went the cock of his double-barrelled gun, as
he raised it to his shoulder, vehemently swearing at the same
time that he would shoot the first man who dared to lay hands
upon the debatable boundary.&nbsp; The assailants wavered.&nbsp;
The squire shouted to them in vain.&nbsp; Even he himself did not
like the look of the double-barrelled gun, but, fixing upon John,
his butler, to be his Marshal Ney, he encouraged him to the
attack.&nbsp; John, however, feeling that &ldquo;discretion was
the better part of valour,&rdquo; hesitated, when his master
again cheered him to the fight with this promise of posthumous
consolation, &ldquo;Never mind him, John; if the scoundrel does
shoot <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>you, we&rsquo;ll have him hanged for it
afterwards.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But please, master,&rdquo; said
John, as wisely and innocently, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you
hanged him first.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was too much.&nbsp; There was
no help for it.&nbsp; Hugoumont was saved.&nbsp; Napoleon and his
forces retreated, baffled and discomfited, from the field.&nbsp;
The squire, peace to his memory, fine old fellow, used often to
tell this story in after years, never failing to revile poor John
for his cowardice, which lost the day.&nbsp; But we always
defended John, and turned the laugh against the squire, by gently
insinuating that there was somebody more interested in the
quarrel, who was even more prudent than prudent John.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dc19.jpg' />he
Church, in the days we are speaking of, was in a very torpid and
sleepy state, not only in Liverpool, but throughout the
land.&nbsp; None of the evangelical clergy had then appeared in
this district, to stimulate the pace of the old-fashioned
jog-trot High Churchmen.&nbsp; Neither had Laudism revived, under
its new name of Puseyism.&nbsp; Nothing was heard from our
pulpits but what might have passed muster at Athens, or been
preached without offence in the great Mosque of Constantinople.
In fact, &ldquo;Extract of Blair&rdquo; was the dose
administered, Sunday after Sunday, by drowsy teachers to drowsy
congregations.&nbsp; If it did no harm, it did no good.&nbsp; We
do not here speak of James Blair, Commissary of Virginia,
President of William and Mary College, etc., whose works, little
known, contain a mine of theological wealth.&nbsp; We allude to
Dr. Hugh Blair, whose sermons, so celebrated in his day and long
after, are really, when analysed, nothing better than a string of
cold moral precepts, mixed up with a few gaudy flowers culled
from the garden of rhetoric.&nbsp; We have often wondered at the
praise beyond measure which Dr. Johnson again and again bestowed
upon Blair&rsquo;s diluted <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>slip-slop and namby-pamby
trifles.&nbsp; He not only spoke of them in the highest terms on
every occasion, but thus, in his strange way, once exclaimed,
&ldquo;I love Blair&rsquo;s sermons.&nbsp; Though the dog is a
Scotchman, and a Presbyterian, and everything he should not be, I
was the first to praise them.&nbsp; Such was my
candour.&rdquo;&nbsp; At all events, as we have already stated,
&ldquo;Extract of Blair&rdquo; was the pulpit panacea universally
prescribed at the beginning of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; And
we are bound to add, as far as our youthful recollections go,
that the majority of the Liverpool clergy in those days were
rather below than above the average of mediocrity.</p>
<p>There were some among them, however, whose names are worth
recalling.&nbsp; One of the best preachers in those old times was
the incumbent of St. Stephen&rsquo;s, Byrom-street, the Rev. G.
H. Piercy, a fine fellow in every way.&nbsp; He is still alive at
his living of Chaddesley, in Worcestershire, to which he was
presented through the influence of old Queen Charlotte.&nbsp; His
mother-in-law, the wife of the Rev. Mr. Sharp, then vicar of
Childwall, had been about the court in some capacity or other,
and it was the good fashion of her Majesty never to forget her
friends.&nbsp; Mr. Piercy must have reached the age of the
patriarchs at least.&nbsp; Then there was the Rev. Mr. Milner, of
St. Catharine&rsquo;s Church, Temple-street, which was removed in
making some improvements in that part of the town.&nbsp; Poor Mr.
Milner!&nbsp; When not washing his hands, he employed each hour
of the day in running after the hour before, and was always
losing ground in the race.&nbsp; A <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>kind-hearted man he was, and a
pleasant one when you could catch him.&nbsp; He was known as
&ldquo;the late Mr. Milner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Rev. Mr. Vause
preached in those days at Christ Church.&nbsp; He was considered
to be a brilliant star in the pulpit, and was indeed a first-rate
scholar, a fellow-student with the illustrious Canning, who made
many and strong efforts to reclaim him from a course of life
which unhappily contradicted and marred all his Sunday
teachings.&nbsp; But, even with regard to his sermons, effective
and telling as they were made by style, voice and manner, it was
found, after his death, when they passed into other hands, that
they were chiefly Blair, with others copied from the popular
writers of the day.&nbsp; A clergyman, who was to preach before
the Archbishop of York, had the choice of them for the
occasion.&nbsp; He picked out the one which seemed to him to be
the most spicy and telling, and, confident at the time that it
was the production of Vause himself, delivered it with mighty
emphasis and stunning effect.&nbsp; When it was over, the
Archbishop blandly smiled, praised it exceedingly, and then, to
the horror and astonishment of the preacher, whispered, &ldquo;I
always liked &mdash;&rsquo;s sermons,&rdquo; naming the author
from whom it was taken.&nbsp; Never did poor jackdaw feel so much
pain at being divested of his borrowed plumage.</p>
<p>One of the ablest men, although a mumbling kind of preacher,
in those times, was the Rev. Mr. Kidd, who was for so many years
one of the curates of Liverpool, a kind of Church serf, who could
never rise to be a Church ruler.&nbsp; He had many kind friends,
and at <a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>many a table which we could mention a plate and knife
and fork were always laid for the poor curate.&nbsp; But he ever
appeared to us to be an oppressed and depressed man, with a
weight upon his spirits which nothing could shake off.&nbsp;
There was indeed a romance attached to his history, although he
was perhaps the most unromantic looking person that the human eye
ever rested upon.&nbsp; He was a brilliant scholar, when a
student at Brasenose College, Oxford, and his hopes and ambition
naturally aspired to a fellowship.&nbsp; It was supposed to be
within his grasp.&nbsp; But how wide is the distance between the
cup and the lip!&nbsp; The principal was unpopular, and some of
his doings were severely flogged in a satirical poem which
appeared without a name.&nbsp; Its cleverness led him to suspect
Mr. Kidd, and, without looking for any other proof of the
authorship, he became his sworn enemy, and used all his
influence, and only too successfully, to turn the election
against him.&nbsp; Some love affair, we have also heard, but this
was, it may be, only &ldquo;one of the tales of our
grand-father,&rdquo; went wrong with him about the same
time.&nbsp; So that, altogether, he was thrown upon the world a
sad and downcast man, with blighted hopes and blasted
expectations from his very youth, and settled down into the
curacy of Liverpool, where he saw more than one generation of
inferior men, inferior in scholarship, in learning, in wit, in
all and everything, promoted over his head.&nbsp; A pleasant,
agreeable, quaint and original companion was poor Kidd amongst
his intimates, but tongue-tied in a large party.&nbsp; He saw
through the hollowness of the world, <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>and despised it.&nbsp; There was
nobody like him for unmasking a sham, and reducing a pretender to
his real and proper dimensions.&nbsp; And then his chuckling
laugh when he had accomplished such a feat, and impaled the human
cockchafer upon the point of his sarcasm!&nbsp; And how bitterly
he would allude to his curate&rsquo;s poverty, as, smacking his
lips over a glass of old port at some friend&rsquo;s table, and
he did not dislike his glass of port, he would tell us that his
own domestic allowance of the same was &ldquo;to smell at the
cork on a week-day, and to take a single glass to support him
through his duties on a Sunday.&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor fellow!&nbsp;
Once upon a time, and such godsends did not often fall to his
portion, he had married a couple among the higher orders, and
received for it a banknote which perfectly dazzled him.&nbsp;
Then came the marriage breakfast, then the marriage dinner.&nbsp;
He was a guest at both, and perhaps took his share of the good
things which were stirring.&nbsp; His way home was through the
Haymarket.&nbsp; Another gentleman, whose path was in the same
direction, hearing a great noise, came up and found our friend
fighting furiously for his fee with a lamp-post, and exclaiming,
as he struck it with his stick, &ldquo;You want to rob me of it,
you scoundrel, do you?&nbsp; But come on, we&rsquo;ll
see!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was a relation of the celebrated Dr. Kidd,
who wrote one of the Bridgewater treatises, and who lately died
at Oxford full of years and honours.</p>
<p>Another well-known clergyman in those days was the Rev. Mr.
Moss, who was afterwards vicar of Walton for so many years.&nbsp;
His share of &ldquo;the drum <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>ecclesiastic&rdquo; was decidedly
the drum stick.&nbsp; But, although a very moderate performer in
the pulpit, he had a very good standing in society, and was very
much liked in his own &ldquo;set.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not over witty
himself, never was man the cause of so much wit in others, and
often at his own expense.&nbsp; He was known in his own circle as
&ldquo;Old England,&rdquo; because &ldquo;he expected every man
to do his duty;&rdquo; that is, he never met a brother clergyman
by any chance without seizing upon him, and asking him if he
could do his duty on the next Sunday.&nbsp; In allusion to his
convivial qualities and bad preaching, somebody once said of him
that &ldquo;he was better in the bottle than in the
wood.&rdquo;&nbsp; This gave him such dreadful offence that he
positively consulted his lawyer on the subject of prosecuting the
impious blasphemer for a libel.&nbsp; The answer to his enquiry
was a hearty laugh on the part of the solicitor himself, with an
intimation that he would be laughed out of court also, amidst a
shower of jokes about the poet&rsquo;s description of the
Oxonians of that day,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Steeped in old prejudice and older
port,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and be poked with all sorts of fun about <i>canting</i>,
<i>recanting</i>, and <i>decanting</i>.&nbsp; The decanter
triumphed, although it was a strong allusion to the original
offending joke, and the idea of a prosecution was abandoned.</p>
<p>Mr. Moss had an intense horror of all sorts of innovations,
and, in the case of the first railway, that between Manchester
and Liverpool, this feeling was greatly increased by the fact of
his being a large <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>shareholder in a certain canal which might be affected
by its success.&nbsp; He was in a fever of excitement and almost
raved whenever the subject was mentioned in company.&nbsp; He
long clung to the notion that the accomplishment of the line was
impossible and fabulous.&nbsp; He magnified every difficulty,
dwelt upon every obstacle, and concluded every harangue on the
question with the triumphant exclamation, &ldquo;But, never mind,
they cannot do it; Chat Moss will stop it; Chat Moss will stop
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was said in allusion to that great boggy
waste, so called, which for so long a time did really battle with
and baffle the skill and efforts of the engineers.&nbsp; On one
occasion, when our friend had been holding forth in his usual
strain, and finished with a look of defiance at all around him,
&ldquo;<i>Chat Moss will stop it</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Thomas Crowther,
who was one of the party, quietly answered, &ldquo;Depend upon
it, your <i>chat</i>, <i>Moss</i>, will not stop it.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This to us is the purest essence of wit, the very <i>ne plus
ultra</i>ism of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The force of humour can no further
go.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Pitt&rsquo;s description of what a battle should be,
&ldquo;it is sharp, short, and decisive.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is
brilliant, pointed, telling.</p>
<p>There is a joke of almost a similar kind in Boswell&rsquo;s
<i>Life of Johnson</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told him&rdquo; (writes
the former) &ldquo;of one of Mr. Burke&rsquo;s playful sallies
upon Dean Marley: &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like the Deanery of Ferns,
it sounds so like a <i>barren</i> title.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Dr.
<i>Heath</i> should have it,&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; Johnson
laughed, and, condescending to trifle in the same mode of
conceit, suggested Dr. <i>Moss</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>But the wit
here is overdone and wire-drawn, until it becomes forced, heavy,
and exhausted.&nbsp; Crowther&rsquo;s <i>extempore</i> retort
beats the laboured efforts of Burke, Boswell, and Johnson, all
put together, as it bursts forth, sparkling, glittering,
dazzling, on the spur of the moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Depend upon it,
your <i>chat</i>, <i>Moss</i>, will not stop it.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
treasure a good thing when we hear it, and love to embalm
it.&nbsp; Mr. Crowther, the author of this unrivalled witticism,
had a twinkle about the eye which seemed to say for him, that he
had many &ldquo;a shot in the locker,&rdquo; of equal calibre and
ready for action.&nbsp; We did not know much of him ourselves,
but have always been told that his stores of humour and wit were
as rich as they were inexhaustible.&nbsp; The specimen, or, as
men say in Liverpool, the sample, which we have given amply
justifies such an opinion.</p>
<p>We must not forget to mention, in connection with the Rev. G.
H. Piercy, that of the sons of Liverpool worthies under his care
in 1804, and who thumbed their lexicons with redoubled zeal when
promised a holiday to witness the marching and counter-marching
of the &ldquo;brave army&rdquo; before his Royal Highness Prince
William of Gloucester, in Mosslake fields or Bankhall Sands,
(where are these now?) the following, although in the &ldquo;sere
and yellow leaf,&rdquo; are still fit for active
service:&mdash;W. C. Ritson, E. Molyneux, Thomas Brandreth, F.
Haywood, R. W. Preston, and James Boardman.&nbsp; The Rev. James
Aspinall, rector of Althorpe, Lincolnshire, was also long a
favourite pupil of the reverend patriarch.</p>

130</span>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dc20.jpg' />he two
rectors of those old days were the Rev. Samuel Renshaw and the
Rev. R. H. Roughsedge.&nbsp; They were both men past the meridian
of life, at the earliest period to which our recollection
extends.&nbsp; There was a tradition among the old ladies, that
Rector Renshaw in his younger days had been a popular and
sparkling preacher of &ldquo;simples culled&rdquo; from
&ldquo;the flowery empire&rdquo; of Blair.&nbsp; We only knew him
as a venerable-looking old gentleman, with a sharp eye, a
particularly benevolent countenance, and a kind word for
everybody.&nbsp; Rector Roughsedge also was a mild, amiable,
good-hearted man of the old school, with much more of the
innocence of the dove than of the wisdom of the serpent in his
composition.&nbsp; He was, in fact, the most guileless and
unsophisticated person we ever met with.&nbsp; His studies must
have been of books.&nbsp; Certainly they had not extended to the
human volume. He was utterly ignorant of the world and the
world&rsquo;s ways, thereby strongly reminding us of the great
navigator, of whom it was said that &ldquo;he had been round the
world, but never in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; As a proof of this we may
mention, that once, when the Bishop of Chester, <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>the present
Bishop of London, was his guest, he invited Alexandr&eacute;, the
ventriloquist, to meet him at breakfast.&nbsp; There surely never
was a worse assortment than this in any cargo of Yankee
&ldquo;notions.&rdquo;&nbsp; Alexandr&eacute;, who had a fair
share of modest assurance, was quite at home, and made great
efforts to draw the bishop into conversation.&nbsp; The latter,
however, rather recoiled from his advances, and was very
monosyllabic in his answers.&nbsp; Nothing daunted, however, the
ventriloquist rattled away quite at his ease, and, amongst other
things, assured his lordship that &ldquo;he had had the honour of
being introduced to several of the episcopacy; that, in fact, he
had received from more than one of them copies of sermons which
they had published, and which he had kept and valued amongst his
greatest treasures;&rdquo; and then finished up with the
expression of a wish that he would himself favour him with a
similar memento.&nbsp; This was too much, and prompt and tart and
cutting was the bishop&rsquo;s answer&mdash;&ldquo;Yes; I will
write one on purpose; it shall be on <span
class="smcap">Modesty</span>!&rdquo;&nbsp; Vulcan never forged
such a thunderbolt as that for Jupiter Tonans himself.&nbsp; It
completely floored Alexandr&eacute;, overwhelming the chaplain
and scorching the rector&rsquo;s wig in its way.</p>
<p>And having mentioned the name of Bishop Bloomfield, let us
give another specimen of his ability to check any improper
intrusion upon his dignity and position.&nbsp; He was a very
young man when first he came into this diocese, and some of the
older clergy rather presumed upon this.&nbsp; There were at that
time many among them who would cross the country, and <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>take a
five-barred gate as if it were that fortieth article of which
Theodore Hook spoke to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford.&nbsp; The
bishop one day met a number of these black-coated Nimrods.&nbsp;
The scene was not far from Manchester.&nbsp; After dinner, some
of the old incorrigibles persevered for a long time, with
marvellously bad taste, in talking of their dogs and horses, and
nothing else.&nbsp; His lordship looked grave, but was
silent.&nbsp; At last, one of them, directing his conversation
immediately to him, began to tell him a long story about a famous
horse which he owned, and &ldquo;which he had lately ridden sixty
miles on the North road without drawing bit.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was
the bishop&rsquo;s turn now, and down came his sledge hammer with
all the force of a steam-engine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said,
with the most cutting indifference, &ldquo;I recollect hearing of
the same feat being once accomplished before, and, by a strange
coincidence, on the North road, too: it was <i>Turpin</i>, <i>the
highwayman</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Warner&rsquo;s long range was
nothing to this.&nbsp; It was a regular stunner.&nbsp; The
reverend fox-hunter had never met with such a rasper
before.&nbsp; He was fairly run to earth, and did not break cover
again that night, you may be sure.&nbsp; The idea of a Church
dignitary, for such he was, having had Turpin for his college
tutor, was a view of the case which he had never studied before,
and old <i>Tally-ho</i> left the table fully convinced that his
spiritual superior was more than his match even at the <i>lex
Tally-ho-nis</i>.&nbsp; The same annoyance was never attempted
again.&nbsp; The lesson had its effect upon more than one.</p>
<p>But to go back to Rector Roughsedge; he also once <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>perpetrated
a joke, and it was so dreadfully heavy that it deserves recording
for its exceeding badness.&nbsp; He was a man of strong opinions,
prejudices some people would call them.&nbsp; He did not like the
evangelical clergy, who so greatly increased in number towards
the latter end of his reign in this locality, and, at their
expense, he perpetrated the single jest of eighty years.&nbsp; He
was at Bangor, on a tour, and, at the same inn there was a large
party of the rival section of the Church.&nbsp; They were in the
room exactly over the one in which he was sitting, and, as they
moved about with rather heavy tread, the old man suddenly
exclaimed, &ldquo;Sure the gentlemen must be walking on their
heads!&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not say much for this ponderous effort
ourselves.&nbsp; But it was, we are informed, duly reported at
the Clerical Club, and entered among their
<i>memorabilia</i>.&nbsp; The curates especially relished it as a
great joke, a very gem of brilliancy, and would persist in
laughing at and repeating it for months and months in all
companies, parties and meetings; and their mirth, it was
observed, was always particularly jocund and boisterous when the
rector himself was present.&nbsp; But who grudges them the
enjoyment of their laugh?&nbsp; A poor curate&rsquo;s life is
such a career of toil and hardship, that anything which can
enliven him, even a rector&rsquo;s jest, should be most
welcome.&nbsp; We, at all events, are not iron-hearted enough to
envy their few enjoyments.&nbsp; But it was real happiness to
hear the old rector and his old wife talk of their son in
India.&nbsp; He was their pride, their boast, their treasure,
their idol.&nbsp; We never met with him; but from all <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>that we
have heard of him, we believe that there was no exaggeration of
praise even in the character which his fond parents drew of
him.&nbsp; Everybody endorsed it as fact, not eulogy.&nbsp; But
<i>the</i> church of churches in that day was St.
George&rsquo;s.&nbsp; How we used to rush down to Castle-street,
about a quarter of an hour before the service began, to see the
mayor and his train march to church!&nbsp; We were never tired of
watching that procession.&nbsp; It was super-royal in our
estimation.&nbsp; Sunday after Sunday we would gaze at it with
never-wearying and still-increasing admiration.&nbsp; Such cloaks
they wore!&nbsp; There never were such cloaks.&nbsp; And such
cocked hats!&nbsp; No other cocked-hats ever seemed to be like
them.&nbsp; And one man carried a huge sword, which, in our
nursery, we verily believed to have been the identical one taken
by David from Goliath, although there was a counter tradition,
which asserted that Richard the First had won it from a Pagan
knight in single combat when in Palestine.&nbsp; We now rather
ascribe a &ldquo;Brummagem&rdquo; origin to it.&nbsp; And there
were other men who carried maces, and various kinds of
paraphernalia, which, if not useful, were supposed to be vastly
ornamental and magnificent.&nbsp; The mayor himself held what was
called a white wand in his hand, which was intended, we opine, to
impress the public with the notion that his worship, for the time
being, was a bit of a conjurer.&nbsp; But even we little boys
knew better than that.&nbsp; Heaven help those dear, darling,
innocent old mayors!&nbsp; They knew how to fish up the green fat
out of a turtle-mug, and had a tolerably correct idea touching
the <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>taste of turbot and lobster-sauce; but as to doing
anything in the conjuring line, they were as guiltless on that
head as any babe unborn.&nbsp; They would never have run any
chance of being burnt for witches.&nbsp; But, nevertheless, it
was a very imposing spectacle to see them tramping along
Castle-street every Sunday morning to St. George&rsquo;s
Church.&nbsp; Our impression always was, that the very Gauls who
paid such small respect to the Roman senate would have trembled
with awe at such a sight.&nbsp; Such was our enthusiasm that,
often as we witnessed it, we still, on our return home, assembled
all our brothers and sister, and arraying ourselves in
table-cloths and great-coats, with the shovel, tongs and poker
carried before us as our official insignia, performed a solemn
march upstairs and downstairs, from garret to cellar, until
interrupted by some older member of the family, who looked upon
our imitations to be as sinful as sacrilege or &ldquo;flat
blasphemy&rdquo; itself.</p>
<p>And what a congregation there used to be at St. George&rsquo;s
in those days!&nbsp; It was a regular cram.&nbsp; Every
corporator had a pew there, and felt himself in duty bound to
attend out of respect to the mayor.&nbsp; And how gay and smart
were the bonnets and dresses of their wives and daughters.&nbsp;
There was one seat in particular which always divided our
attention with the service.&nbsp; It was constantly full of
children, who were not at all more unruly than the rest of
us.&nbsp; But their mother, who was of a very Christian and pious
turn of mind, seemed to be of a different opinion; for when she
thought nobody was watching her (but we were <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>always
watching her), what sly opportunities she would take of pulling
their hair, treading on their toes, and pinching them in all
directions.&nbsp; Pinching was the favourite mode of dealing with
them.&nbsp; How we used to speculate during the sermon upon the
consequences of her practices!&nbsp; We wondered that they did
not cry out.&nbsp; And then we wondered more whether
hair-pulling, toe-treading, and pinching were apostolical
receipts for training young Christians.&nbsp; And then we thought
within ourselves that they would be quite bald in so many years
at the rate of so many hairs pulled out every Sunday; and then we
used to long to know how many square inches of their skin had
turned black and blue under the pinching process, and to
speculate whether their fond mother boxed their ears, or set them
a chapter to learn, or kept them without their dinner when she
got them home, and found that we had grinned them out of all
memory of the text as we telegraphed them out of our pew to let
them know that we were quietly enjoying the fun in theirs.</p>
<p>And what a muster of carriages there always was at St.
George&rsquo;s, to take the corporators and fashionables home
after service.&nbsp; How the coachmen squared their elbows, and
how the horses pranced, and how the footmen banged-to the
doors!&nbsp; And then when &ldquo;all right&rdquo; was heard, how
they dashed off, to the right and left, some taking one turn and
some the other, down narrow old Castle-ditch, and so into narrow
old Lord-street, down which they flew &ldquo;like mad,&rdquo;
until the profane vulgar called these exhibitions &ldquo;the
Liverpool <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>Sunday races!&rdquo;&nbsp; And what a crowd of dandies
and exquisites always assembled on the Athen&aelig;um steps, not
to discuss the sermon, we fear, but to criticise the equipages as
they rattled by, and, when they were gone, to pass judgment upon
the walkers, their dress, appearance, etc.&nbsp; The ladies, we
recollect, invariably pronounced this phalanx of quizzers to be
an accumulation of &ldquo;sad dogs&rdquo; and &ldquo;insufferable
puppies;&rdquo; but it always struck our young mind that it was
very odd, if they really thought so, that they did not avoid them
by ordering their carriages to be driven, or themselves walking,
some other way.&nbsp; If the moth flies into the candle more than
once, we must presume that it does not dislike the operation.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='W' title='W' src='images/dc21.jpg' />e
spoke, in the last chapter, of St. George&rsquo;s as the church
which the mayor and corporation always attended.&nbsp; Once, when
Mr. Jonas Bold was Mayor, it happened that Prince William of
Gloucester was present.&nbsp; By a strange coincidence, which
somewhat disturbed the seriousness of the congregation, the
preacher for the day took for his text, &ldquo;Behold, a greater
than Jonas is here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both Mayor and Prince, we
believe, as well as the discerning public, fancied that there was
something more than chance in the selection of so very telling
and apposite a text.&nbsp; It reminds us of the Cambridge
clergyman, who, when Pitt, Chancellor of the Exchequer, while yet
almost a boy, attended the University Church, preached from the
words, &ldquo;There is a lad here which hath five barley loaves
and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some years since the Duke of Wellington, attended by a single
<i>aide-de-camp</i>, walked into a Church at Cheltenham.&nbsp;
Here there could have been no design; he was totally
unexpected.&nbsp; But, when the text was announced, out came the
startling words, &ldquo;Now, Naaman, captain of the host of the
king of Syria, was a great man with his master and honourable, <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>because by
him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria: he was also a
mighty man in valour, but he was a leper.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
chance shot evidently told.&nbsp; A grim smile seemed for a
moment to gather upon the features of the &ldquo;Iron
Duke,&rdquo; as he cast an intelligent look at his companion, who
telegraphed him in return with an equally knowing glance.&nbsp;
They were both particularly attentive to the sermon, in which
there were many hard hits, which might have been made to order,
as they seemed to be as applicable to Duke Arthur as to Duke
Naaman.</p>
<p>But it is time that we should speak of the clergymen attached
to St. George&rsquo;s Church, in the days we are writing
of.&nbsp; They were rather a superior lot.&nbsp; Archdeacon
Brooks was one of them, and already looked upon as a very
promising young man.&nbsp; The Rev. T. Blundell was
another.&nbsp; He used to bring out occasionally, in preaching,
very odd things in a very odd manner, and sometimes very original
things in a very original manner.&nbsp; The Rev. Jas. Hamer was
another of the preachers at St. George&rsquo;s, and very
admirable sermons he gave.&nbsp; He was a sedate, grave, serious
looking man, a fair scholar, and had a good place in
society.&nbsp; He was a fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford,
and, according to the universal anticipation, would have been its
next head, had he lived.&nbsp; But he was cut off in the prime of
his days, when all the toils and difficulties of his career were
surmounted, and, to human judgment,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The world was all before him, where to
choose<br />
His place of rest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>But
here we must make room on our canvas for the portrait, if we can
draw it, of one of the most remarkable men whom Liverpool has
ever produced.&nbsp; We speak of Dr. Frodsham Hodgson, who, in
our young days, was also among the St. George&rsquo;s
preachers.&nbsp; His manner was pompous, and he had a catch in
his voice which may still be traced among Oxford men of the old
school, some having adopted it from admiration, and others having
mimicked it until they could not get rid of it.&nbsp; Never was
the truism, that &ldquo;a prophet is not a prophet in his own
country,&rdquo; more wonderfully illustrated than in the case of
Dr. Hodgson.&nbsp; Here, in Liverpool, he was neither known,
valued, nor appreciated.&nbsp; He visited chiefly, when amongst
us, with the corporation, and those who met him came away with
the impression that they had spent their time with a very
agreeable and pleasant person, a jovial companion, with great
conversational powers, and, for a book-worm, wonderfully at home
on every subject started and spoken of on every occasion.&nbsp;
This was the opinion generally formed of him, this and nothing
more.&nbsp; Our municipal magnificos, while condescendingly
patronising and listening to their chaplain, never seemed for a
moment to feel that Jupiter himself was among them in
disguise.</p>
<p>But let us change the scene to the University of Oxford.&nbsp;
Ha! who comes here?&nbsp; &ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s himself
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The king&rsquo;s once more at
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is the principal of Brasenose College, the
same Dr. Hodgson whom we lately saw in Liverpool; but, <i>Quantum
mutatis ab illo Hectore</i>, he is here another and a <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>different
man.&nbsp; He is in the scene of his glory, his triumphs, and his
celebrity, among those who honour, respect, and look up to him,
and who are proud to be the followers of such a leader.&nbsp; He
stood out from among them as one of nature&rsquo;s true
nobility.&nbsp; Magnificent in his manner and bearing, princely
in his tastes, and habits, and notions, and ideas, a scholar in
every sense of the word, thoroughly acquainted with, at home in,
every branch of literature, and familiar with all the mysteries
and workings of the human volume, he was exactly the person to
perform a great part wherever his lot of life had been
cast.&nbsp; Accordingly he was a potentate even among the
self-elated potentates of the University.&nbsp; His will was
law.&nbsp; His <i>sic volo sic jubeo</i> was supreme.&nbsp; He
ruled without a rival near the throne.&nbsp; From time to time
murmurs were heard against the autocrat, and the whispering
tokens of a coming storm were frequently perceived.&nbsp; But
mind triumphed over matter.&nbsp; He always contrived to crush
the incipient rebellion, and to rise, like another Ant&aelig;us,
refreshed and strengthened from the struggle.&nbsp; And we may
add here that his ambition was as unbounded as his talents were
great and brilliant.&nbsp; The force of his genius, the power of
his tact, and the extent of his influence were never so
remarkably proved as in the management and clever combinations by
which, with the help of Tory tools subdued to his will, he
contrived to return the Whig Lord Grenville, as Chancellor of the
University of Oxford, against Lord Eldon, the most powerful
opponent whom it was possible for Toryism to have selected for
the struggle <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>in those days of its supremacy.&nbsp; The time at last
arrived when Dr. Hodgson was marked for the next elevation to the
episcopal bench, and he was spoken of for either an English
bishopric or an Irish archbishopric.&nbsp; But who can dive into
the secrets of to-morrow?&nbsp; At the moment when to his friends
and family it seemed certain that all their fond hopes and
anticipations were about to be realised, he was suddenly attacked
by the fatal illness which brought him to the grave in a few
days.&nbsp; To the end of his life he retained all his influence
over the University, and, when he departed, it was as if Gulliver
had been taken from Lilliput, and the Lilliputians left to
themselves.&nbsp; Nothing soaring above the common place of
mediocrity has since shown itself among the college heads and
rulers.&nbsp; When we heard of his death, we exclaimed,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was a man, take him for all in all,<br
/>
We shall not look upon his like again.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor have we since had occasion to recall the exclamation,
either with regard to men in the Church or out of the
Church.&nbsp; And we have yet a more pleasing sight in which to
view the character of Dr. Hodgson, namely, as he was seen in the
domestic circle.&nbsp; It was a positive treat to see him, with
all the pomp and pride of the outer world thrown off, in the
bosom of his family.&nbsp; Never was there so kind and
affectionate a husband, never so fond, and tender, and indulgent
a father.&nbsp; In his home, surrounded by those whom he loved,
and who loved him, he seemed to forget at once <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>all things
beyond, and to leave behind all the aspirations and longings,
pains and pleasures, sweets and bitters of ambition.&nbsp; You
had thought him, perhaps, a cold and calculating competitor in
the race of intriguing rivals for promotion.&nbsp; You had
watched with pleasure his splendid career at college and in the
University.&nbsp; You had admired him as a scholar, been dazzled
by his literary attainments, or struck by his tact and bearing as
a polished and finished courtier, a character on which he laid
such stress that it was a frequent saying with him, that,
&ldquo;in his estimation, manner was everything, next to
religion.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it was in the enjoyment of his home,
to him not figuratively, but really &ldquo;home, sweet
home,&rdquo; that you were at once startled and delighted by
seeing him in the best and most amiable point of view.&nbsp; Here
the exquisite nature of the man was beheld in in all its glory,
affectionate, gentle, and earnest, with a heart overflowing with
every kindly feeling and domestic virtue.&nbsp; &ldquo;The most
loveable man, perhaps,&rdquo; as some one has written of the poet
Moore, &ldquo;that ever lived, judging him in the shade of his
own home, apart from the artificial glare of
society.&rdquo;&nbsp; All selfishness was there renounced.&nbsp;
His happiness was in the happiness of those around, and that
those moments, stolen from his active and proud career, were the
sweetest and most delicious of his life it was impossible to
doubt.&nbsp; He must, like every other public man, often and
often have been taught the bitter truth that &ldquo;all is not
gold that glitters.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, whenever the bubble of
popular applause in which he so delighted was grasped, only to
burst in his hand, <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>whenever the seemingly gorgeous gems of ambition turned
out to be mere trash and tinsel, when they had passed from a
dream or a hope into realities, he could dwell upon his home
treasures, which were to him his greatest &ldquo;joys for
ever,&rdquo; far more precious to him than the world&rsquo;s most
approving smiles, and his best and truest consolation if ever it
frowned upon him.&nbsp; We respect and honour the name of Dr.
Hodgson, when we recollect him as the scholar, the gentleman, and
the clergyman; but we love it and fondly dwell upon it when we
recall his memory as the husband and the father.&nbsp; How little
was he known and how ill understood in his native town! and how
few amongst us even remember him or his name at all!&nbsp; And
yet Liverpool, and she has been a fruitful parent of worthy
children, never had a son of whom she had more cause to be proud
than <span class="smcap">Frodsham Hodgson</span>.&nbsp; We have
but feebly sketched a character which, we trust, some stronger
pen will undertake to delineate in all its fair proportions and
colossal dimensions.&nbsp; Until this is done there will be a gap
in biography which certainly ought to be supplied, and the sooner
the better.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='A' title='A' src='images/dc22.jpg' />n
election was an election, indeed, in those days.&nbsp; It was not
merely a rush to the hustings for a few short hours, and then all
over.&nbsp; There was no getting the lead by ten o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, and winning at once by making a good start.&nbsp;
Votes were then taken by tallies, or tens, each tally marching to
the hustings, with a band of music and colours before it, and
each party bringing up its tally in its regular turn.&nbsp; The
curiosity, and excitement, and suspense, and anxiety were kept
up, day after day, until there was a grand smash at last on one
side or the other; in other words, until &ldquo;no tally&rdquo;
forthcoming in its turn betrayed weakness, and proclaimed that it
was U P with somebody.&nbsp; An election, then, in those times,
was a great and solemn affair with our jolly old freemen, who had
the vote-market all to themselves, no intrusive ten-pounders
having yet been thrust upon the constituency.&nbsp; How well we
recollect the hurly-burly of some of those old elections.&nbsp;
There were two sections of the Tory party always in the field,
the green, or Tarleton party, and the blue, or Gascoigne and
&ldquo;Townside&rdquo; party.&nbsp; But, at a pinch, they always
coalesced against the pinks or Reformers.&nbsp; Among the greens
were the Drinkwaters, <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Hollinsheads, Harpers, etc.&nbsp;
Foremost in the ranks of the blues were the Fosters, Cases,
Aspinalls, Gregsons, Branckers, Clarkes, Leylands, etc.&nbsp; And
the pinks also numbered a gallant phalanx to do battle for them
in every struggle, Earles, Lawrences, Croppers, Rathbones,
Roscoes, Curries, Harveys, Mathers, <i>cum multis
aliis</i>.&nbsp; And how Jack Backhouse and Corf, the butcher,
used to head up the greens on horseback, in Castle-street, both
they and their horses bedizened all over with ribbons of their
favourite hue!&nbsp; And how popular old Tarleton was with the
fishwomen!&nbsp; And then how the Tories would shout for
&ldquo;Negro-slavery, and no Popery!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
Reformers had &ldquo;Civil and Religious Liberty!&rdquo; written
on their flags.&nbsp; And how well we remember one, long before
the opening of the trade to the East Indies, on which was
inscribed, &ldquo;The China trade for ever.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
quite beyond the geography of the party who carried it; for,
supposing it to be an allusion to a competition between home-made
crockery and Dresden china, they had, by way of illustration, or
commentary, hung the flagstaff round with all sorts of specimens
of plates, and dishes, cups and jugs, and so forth.&nbsp; Many a
laugh was raised at their expense, as they marched about in
blessed ignorance of their blunder.</p>
<p>On one occasion, as if foreshadowing events which were to
happen half-a-century later, a big loaf or Free Trade candidate
took the field, to the great delight of all the hungry
non-electors.&nbsp; It seems but as yesterday when, patriotically
braving all the pains and penalties attached to such an audacious
proceeding, we escaped <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>from the nursery to clap our little
hands, and set up our little shout, as we followed the music and
yellow banners of the champion of cheapness and plenty to his
house in Kent-square.&nbsp; His name was Chalmer, and he was the
father of the venerable, and worthy, and clever doctor and town
councillor of that name.&nbsp; Sir Isaac Coffin, too, once made
his appearance here just before an election.&nbsp; It was, of
course, suspected that he had a design upon the borough.&nbsp; If
he had, the intention died in the egg.&nbsp; No chicken ever was
hatched out of it.&nbsp; Richmond, however, instantly fired at
him with a squib, which opens in this unceremonious
fashion:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sir Isaac Coffin&rsquo;s come to town, not
to please the lasses,<br />
But to gull the Whigs, a set of stupid asses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A good story is told against Sir Isaac on the other side of
the Atlantic.&nbsp; He once made a bet that he would find a given
number of gigantic alderman lobsters of the weight of thirty
pounds each.&nbsp; It happened not to be in the lobster season,
and the monsters were not forthcoming on the appointed day.&nbsp;
Sir Isaac, however, not liking to lose his money, sent in certain
depositions to the stakeholders from fishermen on the coast,
stating that they had frequently met with lobsters of the
required weight; to which this pithy answer was returned,
&ldquo;Depositions are not lobsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old freemen of those days were worthy grandsires of their
present worthy grandsons.&nbsp; Some of them were witty rogues in
their generation.&nbsp; One of <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>them, on the eve of an election,
when in a state of intoxication, asked one of the Hope family to
give him a five pound note for his vote.&nbsp; The demand was
indignantly rejected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; rejoined the
incorrigible fellow, &ldquo;if you will not give it me, lend it
me, and you may believe I will return it on any day you
fix.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hope shook his head with resolute
incredulity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the offended elector,
staggering away, &ldquo;they may call you <span
class="smcap">Hope</span>, but hang me if you have either
<i>faith</i> or <i>charity</i> in your composition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we must not pass by, without some remarks, the two soldier
representatives who so long sat for Liverpool in the House of
Commons.&nbsp; General Tarleton was a fearless old guerrilla of
the American war, in which his achievements, successful or
otherwise, proved him to be as brave as the sword he wore, and
were more like the creations of romance than the realities they
were.&nbsp; He was open, frank, and free, with many qualities to
recommend him to popular favour, but no more fit to represent the
mighty interests of Liverpool, even in those days, than any child
of three years old taken out of the street.&nbsp; He had not one
point of the statesman in his whole character.&nbsp; He was as
capriciously selected as he was capriciously ejected by his
friends.&nbsp; He was originally adopted without a single
recommendation.&nbsp; He was finally repudiated without a fault
or failure in addition to those which had marked his career from
the first.&nbsp; We have heard many things laid to the charge of
our old freemen, but they never appeared in so bad a light to us
as when, at the bidding of their employers, or <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>under some
other influence, they almost to a man turned their backs with
freezing indifference upon a candidate towards whom, on all
previous occasions, they had affected to feel an enthusiasm
amounting to positive frenzy.&nbsp; Human nature was never
presented to us in so despicable a point of view.&nbsp; Poor old
Tarleton.&nbsp; We never felt a sympathy for him except when he
was thus suddenly victimised by popular caprice, his former
worshippers flying from their idol.&nbsp; And why?&nbsp; Tell it
not in Gath, if you like, but we will tell it in Liverpool;
because the rich men of his party had set up another image, and
he presented himself for their votes <i>in form&acirc;
pauperis</i>.&nbsp; Say not, or we shall laugh at you, that he
was rejected to make way for the brilliant Canning.&nbsp; Aye,
Canning, all honour and glory to his memory, was the most
brilliant of all the brilliant stars that ever shone in this
lower world of ours.&nbsp; But we never loved brilliancy from our
hearts in Liverpool.&nbsp; We have tolerated it at times for the
sake of other qualities by which it has been accompanied, but we
were always anxious to get rid of it as soon as possible.&nbsp;
Liverpool looks upon able and clever men as Athens looked upon
Aristides.&nbsp; Mediocrity suits our temper best.</p>
<p>But we spoke of General Tarleton&rsquo;s military colleague,
the Castor to his Pollux, General Gascoigne.&nbsp; &ldquo;The old
general,&rdquo; as the latter was familiarly called, was a
remarkable instance of how little is required to make a
legislator.&nbsp; He had all the unfitness of General Tarleton
without his dashing and brilliant exploits as a soldier, to
veneer and varnish over the <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>preter-pluperfect common-place of
his character.&nbsp; He was an ignorant and illiterate man.&nbsp;
This may, perhaps, be ascribed to the early age at which he had
joined the army.&nbsp; At all events, his education must have
been more in the school of Mrs. Malaprop than of Dr.
Syntax.&nbsp; His highest attribute was a species of cunning,
which sometimes did for him what greater talent has failed to do
for other persons.&nbsp; He was a man of intense
selfishness.&nbsp; His gratitude was of that peculiar kind which
burns with a white heat glow for benefits to come, but looks with
cold and freezing eyes upon favours received.&nbsp; He treated
his friends as he did his gloves, that is, he wore out both, and
then cast them from him.&nbsp; He constantly forgot his
supporters at the last election, to coquet with those who, he
hoped, might help him at the next.&nbsp; But such a game could
not be played for ever.</p>
<p>General Tarleton was, we said, in his summary expulsion from
the representation, the victim of ingratitude.&nbsp; When General
Gascoigne&rsquo;s turn came, he was justly punished for his
ingratitude towards so many of his best friends.&nbsp; He had
most industriously earned the fate which overtook him.&nbsp; His
immediate predecessor in the seat for the borough was his
brother, Bamber Gascoigne, of Childwall-hall, whose only daughter
and heiress married, at a later period, the Marquis of
Salisbury.&nbsp; Bamber was a man of a very different stamp and
calibre from his brother.&nbsp; He was a good specimen of the
gentleman of the old school, and very much superior generally to
the country squires of his day.&nbsp; His tastes were refined <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>and
literary.&nbsp; He was a thoroughly educated and well-read
person.&nbsp; He was at once proud and courteous in his manner,
and aristocratic in his bearing.&nbsp; His habits attached him
more to his library than to the arena of the House of Commons,
and he, consequently, did not kill himself with toiling in the
cause of his constituents.&nbsp; On some occasion, a deputation
of our merchants waited upon him to remonstrate upon some alleged
lack of zeal in their behalf.&nbsp; The interview was not a
pleasant one.&nbsp; The member received the remonstrants with
either too little humility or too little courtesy.&nbsp; As they
grew warmer, he became colder and stiffer.&nbsp; The end of the
matter was that they did not exactly part company in a gale of
wind, but, while they gave him notice to quit, they relented so
far that they told him that, out of respect to a family which had
so long represented the town, they would, in depriving him of his
seat, transfer it to his younger brother, the redoubtable
general.&nbsp; It was a pity, for he had every quality which the
other wanted.&nbsp; The thing, however, was done, and for years
Bamber Gascoigne was a stranger to the town for which he had once
sat in parliament.&nbsp; He had received a blow, an insult he
deemed it, which he could never forget, although towards the end
of his life he seems to have forgiven it, and once more, to some
small extent, had some intercourse with Liverpool society.&nbsp;
Mrs. Gascoigne, his wife, however, as excellent and kind-hearted
a person as ever lived, always took a most lively and remarkably
fussy interest in our elections.&nbsp; She felt that, if her
husband <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>could not retain the representation of Liverpool, still
it was a prize worth keeping in the family.&nbsp; It may be that
her husband thought so too, but he was too proud and impassive to
show it.</p>
<p>But let us return to the &ldquo;Old General.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
politics he was a Tory, &ldquo;thorough and
thorough.&rdquo;&nbsp; He never flinched nor wavered, but
followed the banner of his party &ldquo;for better and for
worse,&rdquo; through good report and evil report, to the close
of his career.&nbsp; He was once, indeed, dreadfully puzzled when
a schism occurred amongst the leaders of Toryism.&nbsp; On that
occasion he wrote a letter, said to be still in existence, to a
leading friend in Liverpool, in which he thus expressed
himself:&mdash;&ldquo;Dear &mdash;, I cannot as yet see my way
clearly, or make out which section will prevail, and obtain the
government.&nbsp; Until that is decided, I shall vote
<i>according to my conscience</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is refreshing
to discover even these brief traces of a conscience in a hack
politician of the old school.&nbsp; We have already observed that
the education of the General had not been too carefully
cultivated.&nbsp; He once, in the House of Commons, gave a
remarkable proof of his deficiency, to the great delight of the
young and waggish portion of our legislators.&nbsp; In some
debate, touching the extension of political privileges to the
dissenters, one of the orators had dwelt eloquently upon the
beauty and loveliness of harmony and union between different
sects.&nbsp; Gascoigne rose to do a bit of bigotry for his
friends, but, being most singular in his notions of the
<i>plural</i> of the word used, thus commenced his reply,
&ldquo;I hate to hear all this <a name="page153"></a><span

which ought to exist between different <i>sexes</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He got no further.&nbsp; A regular &ldquo;Hurrah&rdquo; of
laughter burst from every corner of the House.&nbsp; On it went
gathering strength as it advanced, explosion after explosion,
thunderclap after thunderclap, in the wildest confusion.&nbsp;
The younger members shouted with glee and merriment.&nbsp; Grave
old statesmen held their sides, and were nearly thrown into fits
in the vain endeavour to repress their mirth.&nbsp; Mr. Speaker
himself, after an idle attempt to check the row, led the chorus
until the very mace danced upon the table, and every hair of his
wig stood on end in horror at the profanation.&nbsp; Never was
such a scene enacted before or since in the House of Commons; and
what gave the greatest zest to the whole thing was, that the
General seemed to be unconsciously innocent and ignorant that he
was the cause of the unusual commotion which was going on.&nbsp;
It was the greatest performance of his life.&nbsp; In parting
with him, we may as well add here, that, from a quality which we
have before ascribed to him, he was called, his name being Isaac,
&ldquo;Cunning Isaac,&rdquo; both by friends and foes.</p>
<p>In finishing the chapter, we would remark that subscriptions
for electioneering expenses were raised in those times after a
fashion which, we trust and believe, does not prevail at the
present day.&nbsp; The figure written in the list was understood
to be the price of the patronage to be received in return.&nbsp;
There was a regular scale.&nbsp; This was corruption in its most
unblushing and unscrupulous form.</p>

shops frequented by the fashionables were &ldquo;few and far
between&rdquo; in those old times.&nbsp; We had not then reached
the bustling age of competition, colossal plate-glass windows,
and &ldquo;selling off under prime cost;&rdquo; and so, as the
Irishman said, making our fortunes by the amount of business
transacted.&nbsp; One shop greatly patronised by the ladies was
Wilson&rsquo;s, near the old dock, that is, what was the old
dock, but which was most unwisely filled up.&nbsp; The
Custom-house now stands where the Jack Park, and the Mary, and
the Lovely Nancy once rested on the waters after achieving their
homeward voyage, and poked their bowsprits into the windows of
the opposite houses, which were inconveniently near.&nbsp; Wilson
dealt in all sorts of ladies&rsquo; wares, clothing, linen,
table-cloths, etc.</p>
<p>At the bottom of Duke-street there was a kind of ornamental or
nick-nack shop, kept by a Miss Gregson, who had a monopoly of
that line of business.&nbsp; At the corner of King-street and old
Pool-lane, now South Castle-street, there was a famous
haberdashery and silk shop, presided over by a most respectable
person, Mr. Orton.&nbsp; His private residence was in <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>St.
Anne-street, opposite to Mr. Boardman, and next door to Mr.
Huddleston, whose son, John, lived there in 1790, and lives there
still in 1852.&nbsp; There was another in Castle-street, kept by
Mr. Bernard or Brennand, almost as celebrated.&nbsp; We remember
this one more particularly, as several of the young men who stood
behind the counter subsequently embarked as merchants in
different lines of business, and were some of them eminently
successful.&nbsp; One of them died not very long ago, and is
understood to have left an almost princely fortune behind
him.</p>
<p>Danson was then, and for many a long year afterwards, our
<i>Magnus Apollo</i> in the hair-dressing line.&nbsp; Never was
there such a good-natured, polite, kind soul as Danson.&nbsp; He
was the most talkative of haircutters, and they are generally a
talkative race.&nbsp; What demand he used to be in on the eve of
a ball or a great party in those days, when so much stress was
laid upon curls and wiggery!&nbsp; Many a good story was told at
his expense; but gentlemen of his profession have ever been so
martyred.&nbsp; He was said to be of a very inquisitive turn of
mind, and much given to fathoming the why and the wherefore of
every novelty and mystery which came in his way.&nbsp; This
propensity once led him into an awkward scrape.&nbsp;
Shower-baths were not as general and everywhere affairs then as
they are now.&nbsp; Our Apollo, once summoned to put some lady
patroness into curls, had, upon his arrival, to wait some little
time in the ante-room.&nbsp; A tall, oblong, curtained sort of
box met his eye.&nbsp; What could it be?&nbsp; He cautiously
opened the door, peeped and peeped <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>into it, but could make nothing of
it.&nbsp; A string dangled from above.&nbsp; And what was that
for?&nbsp; Our philosopher, bent upon experiment, took it into
his hand; pulled it; and fiz&mdash;souse&mdash;splash! he was not
exactly caught like a rat in a trap, but down came Niagara upon
his devoted head, as quick as lightning, and as loud as
thunder.&nbsp; The victim screamed; while, to enjoy the sport, in
rushed the lady, and the lady&rsquo;s maid, and the lady&rsquo;s
husband, and Prim, the butler, and John, the footman, and Jane,
the housemaid, and Molly, the cook, and Sally, the scullion, and
the children, and the lap-dog, and there was such laughing and
such barking as human misfortune never called forth before.&nbsp;
Merry mourners at a funeral never equalled them in their
uproarious enjoyment.&nbsp; There had not been a richer scene
since Falstaff was &ldquo;carried off in a buck basket,&rdquo;
and then, as he described it, &ldquo;thrown into the Thames and
cooled, glowing hot, in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
that, hissing hot, think of that, Master Brook.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was enough to give a man hydrophobia for life.</p>
<p>Our old stagers must also recollect the Liverpool Hunt of
those days, famous, far and wide, for its good riders, good
horses, and good dogs.&nbsp; It was a glorious sight to the
lovers of the sport to see them turn out when</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A southerly wind and a cloudy sky<br />
Proclaimed it a hunting morn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Haywood, who lived in St. Anne-street, was a leading
Nimrod among them.&nbsp; It was a treat to have <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>a walk
through his stables.&nbsp; And there was Mr. Joseph
M&rsquo;Viccar, with his slight, elegant, and compact figure, who
was second to no man in crossing the country.&nbsp; Nor must we
forget another of them, Peter Carter.&nbsp; Peter was an original
in his way.&nbsp; He loved a good horse and always rode one, and
knew how to do it.&nbsp; When George the Fourth, then Prince of
Wales, visited Liverpool, Peter had a gray horse, of which he was
very fond and very proud.&nbsp; It might have been the very nag
of which it was written,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But the horse of all horses that rivalled
the day<br />
Was the squire&rsquo;s Neck or Nothing, and that was a
gray.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We rather think, if our memory does not play us fast and
loose, that Carter was a member of the Liverpool Light Horse,
which formed the escort of his royal highness from Knowsley to
the town.&nbsp; At all events, the prince saw the horse, and was
much struck with it.&nbsp; The price was asked.&nbsp; A hundred
guineas was the answer.&nbsp; It was to be a bargain.&nbsp; A few
days afterwards a royal groom made his appearance at
Peter&rsquo;s stable.&nbsp; He had come for the horse.&nbsp; Now
it so happened that there was a general impression that the
prince&rsquo;s credit with his banker was not very extensive at
that time.&nbsp; Peter was awake to this.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your money?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgot,&rdquo; etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The groom, as we said before, had come, but the hundred
guineas were not forthcoming.&nbsp; With some people the wish of
royalty is said to be a command, <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>but nothing less than an order upon
the bank would satisfy Peter Carter.&nbsp; No other &ldquo;Open
Sesame&rdquo; would unlock his stable door.&nbsp; We will not
assert that our old acquaintance was familiar with the axiom
which teaches that &ldquo;there is no royal road to
mathematics;&rdquo; but he was sagacious enough to feel that
there was no royal way in horse dealing.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bird in
the hand is worth two in the bush.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had possession
of the horse; he might never get the money.&nbsp; It was,
therefore, to use a vulgar phrase, &ldquo;No go with him;&rdquo;
that is, he would not let the horse go.&nbsp; The groom took his
leave, greatly astonished and disgusted, and nothing more was
ever heard of the matter.&nbsp; And all that we can say of it is,
that Peter was no courtier, but a sensible man of business, while
the gray continued to adorn the Liverpool, instead of the Royal,
Hunt.</p>
<p>And then there was Abraham Lowe, queer, quaint, odd, original,
eccentric, funny, unequalled Abraham Lowe, the huntsman to the
pack.&nbsp; How well we recollect him!&nbsp; When we were a boy
in buttons, that dress which ladies&rsquo; pages now usurp and
monopolise, we had a taste for haunting and strolling about in
the quiet lanes in the neighbourhood of Childwall.&nbsp; We used
to fish in some of the pits in that quarter, that is, we threw in
our line and hook, and watched them by the hour.&nbsp; But the
result was always, like a bad banker&rsquo;s account, &ldquo;No
effects.&rdquo;&nbsp; Probably there were no fish in our
favourite ponds.&nbsp; We have often thought so since.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;hark back&rdquo; to Abraham Lowe!&nbsp; How we did
reverence and respect him!&nbsp; And <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>how we would listen to his peculiar
stories, told in his own peculiar way!&nbsp; We liked and
honoured everything at Childwall.&nbsp; We had a strong regard
for that fine old fellow, Mr. Clarke, of Stand-house.&nbsp; We
rather looked up to the vicar, Mr. Sharpe.&nbsp; We stood in some
sort of awe of Bamber Gascoigne, of the Hall, with his proud and
grave bearing.&nbsp; It was our pleasure to watch the members of
the Childwall Club, at their afternoon sports, with bow and
arrow.&nbsp; It was our delight, when our pockets could afford
it, to devour the exquisite pies which they made at the inn near
the church.&nbsp; But the vicar and the squire, Mr. Clarke, the
club, and even the pies, all paled into nothingness when compared
with Abraham Lowe.&nbsp; We used to wonder whether Nelson and
Julius C&aelig;sar could be at all like him.&nbsp; His horse
always seemed to be the best horse in the world, and his whip the
nicest whip, a little greasy or so, but that looked
knowing.&nbsp; And with what especial reverence his hounds
regarded him!&nbsp; They seemed to know and feel that there was
but one Abraham Lowe in the world, and that he was their
huntsman, and that they were his hounds.&nbsp; And how he would
top the fences and gates!&nbsp; Nothing could stop him!&nbsp; And
what a voice he had when he shouted &ldquo;Tally ho!&rdquo; or
gave the &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; when a hare was up before the
dogs.&nbsp; And who so acquainted with every art, and trick, and
dodge of his craft!&nbsp; How he always hit upon the right spot
for affording the best sport!&nbsp; And who like him for
recovering a lost, or keeping the hounds up to a cold,
scent?&nbsp; Poor Abraham Lowe!&nbsp; It seems but yesterday that
he <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>stood
before us with his tall, wiry figure; all sinew and bone, not a
superfluous ounce of flesh about him.&nbsp; What a treasure of a
character he would have been to Scott, or Dickens, or
Thackeray!&nbsp; Reality is more wonderful than fiction.&nbsp;
These word-painters never delineated anything equal to Abraham
Lowe.&nbsp; Poor Abraham! he was run to earth himself at last,
and we fear that, in his declining years, the world did not smile
upon him as it did at first.&nbsp; Long after the time of which
we have been speaking, we have seen him occasionally creeping
about the streets of Liverpool with his limbs stiffer than they
were of yore, his old top-boots terribly worn and patched, and
his old red coat awfully stained and soiled.&nbsp; We always had
a passing word with him, for the sake of &ldquo;auld lang
syne.&rdquo;&nbsp; He never seemed to be downhearted, but
maintained his independent character to the end of his
days.&nbsp; There are, we trust, other old stagers left who will
join us in saying, &ldquo;Peace to the memory of old Abraham
Lowe.&rdquo; <a name="citation160"></a><a href="#footnote160"
class="citation">[160]</a></p>
<p>And talking of hunters, we were, in those days, occasionally
visited by Nimrods of another sort, of <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>the very
race of the Centaurs themselves.&nbsp; We speak of the Cheshire
squires of the old times, before railways were thought of, and
when Macadam was a theorist.&nbsp; A Cheshire squire was then a
remarkable peculiarity of the &ldquo;old-fashioned English
gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was proud of his family, of his house,
of his grounds, of his horses, of his dogs, and of everything
belonging to him.&nbsp; But he was especially proud of his
county, and his county was especially fond of him.&nbsp; He
seldom passed beyond its borders, except when a fox led the
hounds over them.&nbsp; He was constant in his attendance at the
Hoo-green Club, where the conversation, not dazzlingly
intellectual, generally ran upon proud Cheshire, and its right to
be called proud Cheshire, with an occasional episode upon horses,
dogs, the crops, the weather, and &ldquo;the next
meet.&rdquo;&nbsp; A long frost in the winter was a terrible
interruption to the comforts and habits of these gentlemen.&nbsp;
At such times they would, although not often, get as far as
Liverpool, to lay in a stock of wine and so forth.&nbsp; You
might always know them.&nbsp; The Cheshire squire, when
perambulating our streets in the old times, wore a low crowned
hat, a cut-away green coat, and a stripy sort of waistcoat,
buckskins, and top boots, looking very like what, in these days,
is vulgarly called &ldquo;a regular swell.&rdquo;&nbsp; There
were some curious characters, very original, spicy, and eccentric
among them.&nbsp; How well we recollect old Sir Peter
Warburton.&nbsp; He was for many years the master of the Cheshire
Hunt.&nbsp; For some reason or other there was not much love lost
between him and the people of Knutsford.&nbsp; One day, <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>when the
hounds were at fault, a sudden &ldquo;Tally ho!&rdquo; was heard
from a distant hill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said
the baronet.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Knutsford man,&rdquo; answered the
huntsman.&nbsp; At the same moment a favourite dog gave tongue,
and led off the pack in another direction.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hark to
Jowler! hark! hark!&rdquo; shouted Sir Peter, adding with a most
uncomplimentary emphasis, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather believe that
dog than any man in Knutsford!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Harry Mainwaring was another of these antediluvian
worthies and wonders.&nbsp; He took the direction of the hounds
after the death of Sir Peter.&nbsp; He was a hard rider, and
loved his glass of port after the fatigues of the day.&nbsp; At
one time his constitution was supposed to be somewhat shaken by
these combined labours of love, and his medical adviser was
called in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;you
are overtaxing your strength in every way.&nbsp; You should go
out with the hounds one day less each week; and you must reduce
your allowance of wine.&nbsp; You are destroying the coats of
your stomach.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, hang me, doctor, if I do
not fight in out in my <i>waistcoat</i>,&rdquo; said the quaint,
eccentric old baronet.&nbsp; And truly, medical science was
baffled in this instance; for, instead of following the advice of
the physician, he added another to his hunting days per week, and
doubled his portion of wine, laughed at the doctor, and grew fat
and strong.&nbsp; And let us add another story about Sir
Harry.&nbsp; It speaks for his heart, and deserves to be
told.&nbsp; He called at Hoo-green one day to return a bad five
pound note which he had received from the innkeeper at his last
visit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that it will
be no <a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>loss to you, and that you know from whom you received
it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh yes! Sir Harry, it&rsquo;s all right;
I took it from Mr. &mdash;,&rdquo; he answered, naming a poor
curate in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; They were standing by the
fire, and Sir Harry had still the note in his hand.&nbsp; In an
instant it was torn to fragments and in the flames, while he
said, &ldquo;Poor fellow!&nbsp; I can stand the loss of it better
than he can; and see that you don&rsquo;t make him uncomfortable
by telling him anything about it.&nbsp; He might feel uneasy at
being in any way obliged to me;&rdquo; and in another moment he
was on horseback and galloping down the lane.&nbsp; Honour to the
memory of this brave old baronet!&nbsp; In this one act, so
beautifully done, there was a combination of pure benevolence and
true delicacy of feeling which could not possibly be
surpassed.&nbsp; It could not have been done more kindly; it
could not have been done more gracefully.&nbsp; The heart of the
wild huntsman was in its right place.</p>

<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dc24.jpg'
/>ravelling was both a difficult and a dangerous operation in
former days.&nbsp; We do not know when a direct communication by
coach between Liverpool and London was first established; but we
have been told that some sort of stage was started to Warrington
and Manchester in the year 1767.&nbsp; We have indeed read in an
old Liverpool <i>Chronicle</i>, January 21st, 1768, that John
Stonehewer, a driver of the said stage, had broken his thigh by a
fall from the box, a very likely accident in those old-fashioned
days of rough stone pavements.&nbsp; Many of our readers must
recollect with what persevering tenacity the shaking old road
between Liverpool and Prescot was maintained as part and parcel
of the British constitution, to the great loss and damage of our
more modern coach proprietors, whose vehicles were more tried and
injured by the eight miles of paving stones between these two
towns than by all the rest of the journey to the
metropolis.&nbsp; The surveyors stood by the paving stones to the
last.&nbsp; Liverpool always adhered to the old ways, however
rough they might be.&nbsp; Macadam, &ldquo;the Colossus of
roads,&rdquo; as some wit called him, was an <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>innovator;
what right had he to make improvements which would militate
against the trade of coach-builders and menders?&nbsp;
Macadam!&nbsp; What a short reign was his?</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Come like shadows; so depart!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hardly had he grasped his sceptre firmly in his hand, and
persuaded the people to mend their ways, when another and a
mightier magician waved his wand, and all was changed.&nbsp;
George Stephenson and railways burst upon us, and Macadam&rsquo;s
meteor flight was brought to a sudden close.&nbsp; The fast man
gave way to the faster.</p>
<p>The first coach which we can ourselves recollect travelling by
was of a very long shape, and moved at a very slow pace.&nbsp;
Its destination was Birmingham, at which we ultimately, after
many delays and dangers, managed to arrive.&nbsp; It had many
&ldquo;odoriferous names,&rdquo; as Mrs. Malaprop would say,
among which &ldquo;the cheap and nasty&rdquo; was the most
prominent and usual.&nbsp; The coachman was a fat man, with a
low-crowned hat, and a large nosegay stuck in his button-hole,
the very man, we should say, who sat for the picture of old Mr.
Weller in <i>Pickwick</i>.&nbsp; What business he had to transact
on the road!&nbsp; He seemed to be the universal agent for the
universal affairs of all mankind, between town and town, and
village and village.&nbsp; And what stoppages, not only at
public-houses, but &ldquo;here, there and everywhere,&rdquo; had
the miserable passengers consequently to undergo!&nbsp; And what
universal flirtations he used to carry on with the <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>universal
womankind who dwelt by the wayside!&nbsp; He appeared to have
reached high pressure or breach-of-promise point with some inmate
of every cottage on the road.&nbsp; And then when at last we
reached Birmingham, into what universal fleadom we found that we
had plunged when we went to bed!&nbsp; We have eschewed sleeping
at Birmingham ever since.&nbsp; A Birmingham bed is a perfect
&ldquo;Cannibal Isle,&rdquo; with a more carnivorous population
than can be met with in any part of the globe.&nbsp; There is
even less danger of being devoured in New Zealand itself.</p>
<p>But a new era sprang up in the coaching business.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Bang-up&rdquo; was started for Birmingham, and the
&ldquo;Umpire&rdquo; for London.&nbsp; Those were splendid
conveyances compared with their slow moving predecessors,
combining, as they did, speed, safety, regularity and
comfort.&nbsp; They were literally the timekeepers for the
several towns and villages through which they passed.&nbsp; They
started to a moment, arrived at each stage to a moment, and
reached their final destination to a moment.&nbsp; The regularity
of the dial could not have been greater.&nbsp; We have heard of
the man who boasted that his clock regulated the sun, and truly
the old Umpire and Bang-up seemed to regulate the clock.&nbsp;
But &ldquo;where are they now?&rdquo;&nbsp; An echo answers,
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;&nbsp; Enter, as we have said before, George
Stephenson, and exit Bretherton.&nbsp; Railways came in and
coaches went out.&nbsp; <i>Sic transit gloria mundi</i>.&nbsp; We
are all for speed now.&nbsp; The march of improvement first
became a run, then a gallop, and now it has increased into a
flight, beating wings and the wind.&nbsp; <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>But,
nevertheless, it was pleasant travelling in those old days,
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the guard; smack went the whip;
&ldquo;off she goes!&rdquo;&nbsp; What a team!&nbsp; How the bits
of blood do their work!&nbsp; Even the experienced hands of the
veteran Jehu can hardly tame their fire and check their
speed.&nbsp; And now the horn blows, we dash into the
market-place of some country town, to the delight of the
congregated idlers and gazers of the place.&nbsp; What a bustle
among the grooms and stable boys.&nbsp; Parcels are handed up and
down; the smoking horses are unharnessed; fresh ones put to, all
in less time than it takes to tell it.&nbsp; Off again!&nbsp; We
sweep at speed past the village green, dogs barking, pigs
squealing, geese hissing, children shouting, men huzzaing, women
smiling.&nbsp; Through the winding pleasant lanes we go, with
their lovely hedgerows on either side, the spire in the distance,
the mansion in the park, the glorious old trees, the noble woods,
the delicious lakes, the sparkling streams, altogether a
landscape of sweetness and beauty which no country but merry
England can set before the traveller&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; All this,
however, was lost to us when the last of the coaches disappeared
from the road.&nbsp; We now fly, but we do not see.&nbsp; We are,
as it were, shot forth from station to station at a speed
becoming the spirit of the age.&nbsp; But one consequence of all
this is, that the rising generation know nothing of the old
high-ways and by-ways of their country, its many beauties, its
shady lanes, its lovely nooks and corners, the sudden turns in
our old lines of road which used unexpectedly to open to us the
most charming prospect, and then as suddenly to <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>hide it,
only to reveal to us some other vision of beauty on the fair face
of nature spread before us.&nbsp; These were exquisite treats to
us old travellers.&nbsp; We miss them, but we are not
regretting.&nbsp; We like to keep up with the pace of the
age.</p>
<p>And what early hours our grandfathers and grandmothers used to
keep!&nbsp; What an anarchical, chaotical, daring, radical
innovator, the very <i>&aelig;s triplex circum pectus</i> man of
old Horace, was that bold spirit considered to be amongst them
who first wrote four o&rsquo;clock, instead of mid-day, upon his
&ldquo;ticket for soup.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then came dinner at five, at
six, and all hours, until day and night changed places, and late
hours and indigestion became triumphant, until wise people
learned that the best plan was to lay in a stock of solids at
lunch, and then only trifle and coquet with the grand banquet of
the evening.</p>
<p>But how different was the style of visiting in those days from
what it is now.&nbsp; About five or six o&rsquo;clock you might
see the ladies on a visit to the house of some one of their
number, who was giving what was called &ldquo;a rout&rdquo; to
her female friends.&nbsp; We speak advisedly when we say her
female friends, because it was as difficult to press a gentleman
into the service on such occasions as to catch an ostrich or a
real live rhinoceros.&nbsp; A treasure, indeed, was the man, and
a star, and an idol, who would come to these parties.&nbsp; Dr.
Gerard, once mayor of Liverpool, was an especial pet with the
ladies in St. Anne-street for accepting all their invitations to
these meetings.&nbsp; But what was a rout?&nbsp; It was a muster
of all her female friends, with <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>the <i>rara avis</i> of a gentleman,
if, like Mrs. Glass&rsquo;s hare in the cookery book, one could
be caught by the heroine or lady-hostess of the evening.&nbsp;
The custom was to crowd as many guests as possible into a small
room, or a large one, as the case might be.&nbsp; As the hour for
assembling arrived, there was a tremendous crush of sedan-chairs
towards the mansion where the party was given.&nbsp; There were
several stands for these old-fashioned conveyances in
Newington-bridge.&nbsp; Those ladies who were not so magnificent
in their notions, or more moderate in their pocket, might be seen
making their way to the festival with what were called calashes
over their heads, a reduced form of the covering still raised
over gigs on a rainy day.&nbsp; When the party, or a sufficient
number to commence operations, had mustered, tea and coffee,
rather weak than strong, and bread and butter, rather thin than
thick, were handed round.&nbsp; This ceremony performed, the
business of the evening fairly began.&nbsp; The lady of the house
made up her card tables.&nbsp; Some would sit down to whist, of
course, in those old days, long antediluvian patriarchal whist,
silver threepences the stake, and nothing more.&nbsp; Short whist
had not then come in, with gas, steam railways, and electric
telegraphs.&nbsp; But the favourite game with the ladies was one
called quadrille or preference.&nbsp; Perhaps they liked it
better than whist because it was carried on with more
talking.&nbsp; We never could fathom its mysteries.&nbsp; In
truth, we never tried to dive into them.&nbsp; All that we
recollect of it is, that it went on with a dreadful clamour about
the &ldquo;pool,&rdquo; &ldquo;basting,&rdquo;
&ldquo;spadille,&rdquo; <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>&ldquo;manille,&rdquo;
&ldquo;ponto,&rdquo; and &ldquo;basto;&rdquo; some of which
phrases sounded very like Egyptian hieroglyphics turned into
language, while others had a sporting smack about them.&nbsp;
Indeed we are not certain whether &ldquo;ponto&rdquo; is not
altogether a fiction or confusion of our memory.&nbsp; When the
lady of the house began to tire, or fancied that her company
began to flag or look fatigued over their cards, she gave the
signal, and in rushed the servants with the trays, on which were
spread refreshments of a very mild and innocent character.&nbsp;
Ices were almost unknown in those days.&nbsp; Weak lemonade and
weaker negus, with jumbles and ratafia cakes, were handed round,
and, as they were nibbled and sipped at, Mrs. Gildart would vow
that she was nearly ruined by a run of bad luck, which had
impoverished her to the amount of two-and-sixpence.&nbsp; Dr.
Gerard would meekly affirm that he had had a most delightful
evening.&nbsp; Robert Norris would lay his hand upon his heart,
and swear that he was always at the service of the ladies.&nbsp;
Beau Sealy, still, we are told, a flourishing and vigorous plant
somewhere near Bridgewater, would smile one of his demure smiles,
and say ditto to Norris, ditto to Gerard.&nbsp; The hostess was
delighted; the ladies were in raptures.&nbsp; Who like
Norris?&nbsp; Who like Gerard?&nbsp; Who, especially, like Sealy?
Sealy being single, as he is single still.&nbsp; By this time all
the nibbling and sipping were over.&nbsp; The jumbles, and cakes,
and negus, and lemonade had disappeared.&nbsp; The candles were
burning low.&nbsp; There was a cry for the calashes, and a rush
to the sedans, and &ldquo;the feast of reason <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>and the
flow of soul&rdquo; were at an end for that evening.&nbsp; And
all this happiness, recollect, was achieved before nine
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Our mothers and grandmothers were unrobing
for the night before their glasses at the hour at which our
modern belles are sitting before theirs, clasping the sparkling
necklace, arranging the last curl, and practising the fatal smile
which is to do such execution at the Wellington-rooms or some
private party.&nbsp; We will not attempt to decide upon the
charms of the ancient and modern <i>Houris</i>; but the
<i>hours</i> kept by the former were certainly more reasonable
and seasonable.&nbsp; They had the advantage of all &ldquo;the
beauty sleep,&rdquo; which is said to come before midnight.</p>

172</span>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<p>
<img class='dc' alt='T' title='T' src='images/dc25.jpg' />here
must be many old stagers still surviving amongst us who can
remember the two managers of the Theatre Royal, Messrs. Knight
and Lewis.&nbsp; The latter was the father of Mr. Thomas Lewis,
so well known to the present and last generations.&nbsp; In
<i>Tyke</i> and similar characters Knight was unequalled; while
Lewis was the best <i>Mercutio</i> ever seen upon the stage. Both
were gentlemen, and much liked in society.&nbsp; In those days,
moreover, we had occasional visits from the celebrated John
Kemble, and his as celebrated sister, Mrs. Siddons, when they
were &ldquo;starring it&rdquo; in the provinces.&nbsp; Cooke,
likewise, the predecessor of Kean in his peculiar line of
characters, often appeared upon the Liverpool boards.&nbsp; He
was not famous for his sobriety, and one night, being hissed for
his usual sin, he rushed forward to the lights, and most
unceremoniously told the audience that &ldquo;he was not there to
be insulted by a set of wretches, every brick in whose infernal
town was cemented by an African&rsquo;s blood!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
was a home thrust for our grandfathers.&nbsp; <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Fortunately
for the offender, Lynch-law was unknown in those times, or he
might have been the author and hero of a tragedy of his own.</p>
<p>And what glorious singers used to warble in our music-hall in
those days!&nbsp; We can just remember them, although singing to
us, in our babyhood and childhood, was very like &ldquo;wasting
their sweetness on the desert air.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among them were
Incledon, Bartleman, Braham, the <i>semper florens</i>, then in
his prime, if not ever since and always in his prime; Mrs.
Billington, and, above all and before all, that wonder of the
world, Catalani herself.&nbsp; It is something to say that we
have heard this glorious songstress, although then quite unable
to appreciate her spirit-stirring and soul-melting notes.</p>
<p>But we forgot to mention Elliston among our list of actors;
eccentric, clever, well-educated, well-read, accomplished,
amusing, gentlemanly Elliston.&nbsp; He was a prodigious
favourite in Liverpool, as much so off as on the stage.&nbsp; He
was ever a welcome guest at the tables of our merchant princes,
and, by his powers of conversation and amazing fund of
information, well repaid all the attentions which he
received.&nbsp; His range of characters, both in tragedy and
comedy, was a very extensive one.&nbsp; His performance in
<i>Three and the Deuce</i> was the perfection of acting, and,
however often repeated, never failed to command the rapturous
applause of the theatre-going public of Liverpool.&nbsp; A
pleasant, agreeable man was Elliston, full of fun, abounding in
good stories, and with an encyclop&aelig;dia of anecdotes at his
command.&nbsp; He was <a name="page174"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 174</span>somewhat proud of his profession,
and his profession was proud of him.&nbsp; It lost nothing when
represented in his person.</p>
<p>And now, as we bring our reminiscences to a conclusion, we
must not omit to chronicle that, three times since memory and
observation dawned within us, we have seen Liverpool overwhelmed
by grief and sorrow.&nbsp; The first of these occasions was when
the intelligence arrived of the death of Nelson, in achieving the
greatest of his great victories, that of Trafalgar.&nbsp; As a
sailor, and the chief of sailors, he was an especial favourite in
this seaport town.&nbsp; His name was among our &ldquo;household
words.&rdquo;&nbsp; His life, a thousand romances in one reality,
was the popular theme at every table, and round every fire.&nbsp;
Wellington was in the bud then, and all the talk was of Nelson,
Nelson, nothing but Nelson.&nbsp; When, therefore, the account of
his death was received, there was not a man in Liverpool but
wished with all his heart and soul that the battle had been
unfought, and the victory unwon, and the departed hero yet alive
and spared to us.&nbsp; It seemed, so intense was the feeling of
regret, as if the destroying angel had again passed through the
land, as of old through Egypt, and taken one from every
house.&nbsp; Grief was in every family, lamentation in every
circle, sorrow on every countenance.&nbsp; These feelings were
the more intense in Liverpool, inasmuch as the intelligence of
the hero&rsquo;s death followed close upon a letter from himself,
in which he announced his intention, as he had never yet seen
&ldquo;the good old town,&rdquo; of paying it a visit, as soon <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>as he had
&ldquo;settled his small account&rdquo; with the French and
Spanish fleets, which he was then blockading in Cadiz.&nbsp; How
uncertain are the events of this life!&nbsp; We wept the hero
dead, whom we hoped to welcome in all the pride and brilliancy of
his glory!&nbsp; The envelope containing the letter in which the
announcement alluded to was made, hung for many a long year, in a
splendid frame, in the dining-room of Mr. J. B. Aspinall, of
Duke-street.&nbsp; But there are hero-worshippers yet surviving,
who look up to Nelson as their idol.&nbsp; A few months since we
entered a cottage in a remote district, far from Liverpool.&nbsp;
Our eye at once settled upon an autograph, framed and suspended
against the wall.&nbsp; It was Nelson&rsquo;s handwriting.&nbsp;
The owner of the house entered as we were gazing at it, and
seeing how we were employed, remarked, &ldquo;That is the
greatest treasure I possess.&nbsp; Nothing on earth should
separate me from it while I live.&rdquo;&nbsp; We looked at the
man, who seemed not to have a spark of enthusiasm in his
composition on any other subject; but, upon talking to him, we
found that his whole soul was wrapped up in adoration of the
memory of Nelson.&nbsp; We may not wonder, then, when such a
feeling is found to exist now, at the burst of enthusiasm which
echoed through the nation during the life, and at the death, of
the popular idol; and what a subscription was raised for a
monument to the mighty and fallen hero!&nbsp; And what
collections were made in all our churches for the widows and
orphans of the brave defenders of their country, who fought and
were killed on the same day with their glorious <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>chief!&nbsp; But Liverpool was never deaf to the call
and inspirations of charity.&nbsp; To the poet&rsquo;s
question,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Art thou content to be the modern Tyre,<br
/>
Half pedlar and half tyrant of the world?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>she may proudly and truly answer, that she has ever recognised
and acted upon a loftier and nobler mission.&nbsp; Behold her
Infirmary, her Blind Asylum, her Dispensaries, her Hospitals, her
institutions of every kind, for every form and shape in which woe
and want come upon mankind!&nbsp; Freely have her sons of many
generations received, and freely have they given.&nbsp; They are
not perfect, but selfishness has never been among their
faults.</p>
<p>The second time when Liverpool, within our recollection, was
struck with distress, but it was altogether of another character,
was when the great West Indian merchant, George Bailey,
failed.&nbsp; It was thought at the time that nobody could
survive the shock.&nbsp; For a season all trade was checked, all
credit and confidence paralysed, and &ldquo;Who next?&rdquo; was
the question of every day in every mouth, as men walked about
doubtingly on &rsquo;Change, and looked into every new
<i>Gazette</i> with fear and trembling.</p>
<p>The third season of consternation to which we have alluded was
the actual panic occasioned by the abolition of the African slave
trade.&nbsp; Our whole community was terror-stricken, when the
cause of philanthropy triumphed in Parliament, and it was decreed
that England should no longer play a guilty part in perpetrating
and perpetuating the horrors of the middle <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>passage.&nbsp; When this was proclaimed in Liverpool,
prophets of woe and evil sprung up in every street.&nbsp;
Destruction was about to fall upon us, chaos was to come again,
an <i>avalanche</i> was to overwhelm us, or an earthquake to
swallow us up, grass was to grow in the area of the
Exchange-buildings, our warehouses were to moulder into ruins,
the streets were to be ploughed up, the docks were to become
fish-ponds, and our mercantile navy, whose keels penetrate to
every land, and whose white sails woo the breeze on every ocean,
was to dwindle into a fishing vessel or two, or be utterly
extinguished.&nbsp; It is true that there were some men amongst
us of too sanguine or too sagacious a spirit to believe in these
melancholy predictions.&nbsp; They had yet hope or faith in the
development of the resources and energies of their
townsmen.&nbsp; Among them we must place Mr. Shaw, of Everton,
and Mr. Edward Houghton, of Great Nelson-street, both large
holders of land in their respective neighbourhoods, who,
influenced by an inward and assured conviction that Liverpool,
cut off from one branch of trade, had yet a great future before
her, calmly &ldquo;bided their time,&rdquo; and waited for the
period when the town would reach them, and building land at so
much per yard would be the cry.&nbsp; Above all Mr. Leigh, the
solicitor, one of the shrewdest men of his day, clung to this
notion, and boldly speculated upon it.&nbsp; And the result has
been, in his case, that his son, Mr. John Shaw Leigh, is one of
the wealthiest, probably the wealthiest, commoner in England,
able, as some one lately observed in his presence, &ldquo;not
only to buy up <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>a duke, but half-a-dozen dukes, if they were in the
market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But these far-seeing men were the exceptions.&nbsp; Ruin to
Liverpool was the general fear of her inhabitants upon the
abolition of the slave-trade.&nbsp; We wonder now, when we look
back, that England, and Englishmen, should ever have tolerated
and sanctioned the nefarious traffic in human flesh.&nbsp; But,
while the trade existed, it had champions and defenders, not only
among those who were interested in it, but among classes whose
blindness can only be attributed to prejudice, the offspring of
habit and custom.&nbsp; Thus, Boswell, in his <i>Life of
Johnson</i>, calmly writes, &ldquo;The wild and dangerous attempt
which has been for some time persisted in to obtain an act of our
Legislature, to abolish so very important and necessary a branch
of commercial interest, must have been crushed at once, had not
the insignificance of the zealots who vainly took the lead in it
made the vast body of planters, merchants, and others, whose
immense properties are involved in the trade, reasonably enough
suppose that there could be no danger.&nbsp; The encouragement
which the attempt has received excites my wonder and indignation,
and, though some men of superior abilities have supported it,
whether from a love of temporary popularity, when prosperous, or
a love of general mischief, when desperate, my opinion is
unshaken.&nbsp; To abolish a <i>status</i>, which, in all ages,
God has sanctioned, and man has continued, would not only be
<i>robbery</i> to an innumerable class of our fellow-subjects,
but it would be extreme cruelty to <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>the African savages, a portion of
whom it saves from massacre and intolerable bondage in their own
country, and introduces into a much happier state of life,
especially now when their passage to the West Indies, and their
treatment there, is humanely regulated.&nbsp; To abolish this
trade would be, to</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Shut the gates of mercy on
mankind.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whatever may have passed elsewhere concerning it, the House of
Lords is wise and independent.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Intaminatis fulget honoribus</i>;<br />
<i>Nec sumit aut ponit secures</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Arbitrio popularis aur&aelig;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the hollow and feeble sophistry of such men as Mr.
James Boswell, and so fondly and foolishly did they talk.</p>
<p>But not of his opinion was our own noble and immortal Roscoe,
who devoted a long life to the cause of philanthropy, and battled
for freedom for the slave in every variety of ways, beginning
with his poem of &ldquo;Mount Pleasant,&rdquo; and ending with
his vote for abolition in the House of Commons.&nbsp; But not of
his opinion were the Wilberforces, and Clarksons, and Macaulays,
and Croppers, and Rathbones, and Rushtons, and Curries, who
fought the great battle of outraged humanity, at first, against
mighty and tremendous odds, but still struggling on,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like a thundercloud streaming against the
wind.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>until the <i>popularis aura</i>, public opinion, pronounced <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>in their
favour.&nbsp; Then was heard the <i>sic volo</i>, <i>sic
jubeo</i>, of the British people; and truly, in this instance, we
may say it was <i>vox populi</i>, <i>vox Dei</i>.&nbsp; Justice
triumphed.&nbsp; The foulest blot which ever darkened the name of
England was removed.&nbsp; The slave-trade was abolished.&nbsp;
And what became of Liverpool?&nbsp; Were the melancholy
predictions of her prophets fulfilled?&nbsp; Were her docks
turned into fish-ponds?&nbsp; Did the mower cut hay, or the
reaper gather in his harvest, in her deserted streets?&nbsp; Look
round, and see.&nbsp; Compare what she was then with what she is
now.&nbsp; Then we counted her inhabitants by tens, now by
hundreds, of thousands.&nbsp; Then we talked of her acres, now of
her miles, of docks.&nbsp; New channels of commerce sprung up,
new fields of adventure and enterprise were discovered in the
East and the West, and the far off South.&nbsp; Steam gave an
additional impulse to the gigantic energies of trade, the
manufacturing districts soared to the miraculous point of
prosperity which they have attained, and Liverpool was the main
artery through which all the imports and exports of these busy
hives of industry unceasingly flowed.</p>
<p>What a different place the town is now from what it was when
first we old stagers knew it, and were acquainted with every face
which flitted through its streets!&nbsp; So changed, so altered
is it!&nbsp; Old streets and old buildings gone, and new ones
occupying their places; streets where once were fields; docks
where of old were strand, and shore, and forts, and baths;
retired villages swallowed up by the insatiable and still growing
town; trees, gardens, meadows, corn <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>land, all yielding to the spread of
brick and mortar.&nbsp; So marvellous are all these things, that,
as we wander through the transmuted scene, losing and finding our
way by turns, we know not how to describe the feelings which
swell within us;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We see, we recognise, and almost deem<br />
The present dubious, or the past a dream!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what of the future of Liverpool?&nbsp; Has she reached the
meridian height of her glory and prosperity? or is she yet in her
dawn and beginning?&nbsp; Shall we moralise upon the fate of
Tyre, of Carthage, of Genoa, and Venice, and other marts of
commerce in bygone days?&nbsp; It was not for such a purpose that
we took up our pen.&nbsp; We do not aspire to be prophets.&nbsp;
But as yet no cloud is in the sky.&nbsp; All is bright and clear
above the horizon; all is fair, promising, hopeful.&nbsp; And
when we contemplate &ldquo;the good old town,&rdquo; in which we
have spent so many happy years, and to which we are bound by so
many ties of friendship and affection, we take leave of her with
the prayer of the Italian for his country&mdash;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
